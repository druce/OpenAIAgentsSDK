Nvidia performance can remain later as supporting context.\\n\\nFormatting consistency checklist\\n- Use sentence case for all headlines; remove trailing periods.\\n- Keep each headline under 25 words (current set is compliant after minor trims).\\n- Use ASCII hyphens and consistent number/currency formatting (e.g., “$35 billion,” “Q2 2025”).\\n\\nNo duplicates found\\n- No redundant headlines or links across or within sections.\\n\\nImplementing the above will bring the draft in line with the required structure, tighten section coherence, and improve clarity and polish without changing meaning or links.\"\n"

      "- Timely mix of policy, markets, methods, and product updates; solid link density (1/link per headline), neutral tone, and no duplicate URLs.\n",
      "- Section titles are generally clear and creative; story ordering is broadly logical with “Other News” placed last.\n",
      "\n",
      "Top recommendations (highest impact first)\n",
      "1) Fix markdown structure: add a single # newsletter headline at the top and change all section titles to ##.\n",
      "2) Split the broad first section into two tighter sections to improve thematic coherence and scannability.\n",
      "3) Standardize headline style: sentence case, no trailing periods, avoid vague terms, use ASCII hyphens, and keep money figures explicit (e.g., “$35 billion”).\n",
      "4) Move the Anthropic prompt-engineering item from “Other News” to “Agentic AI” to strengthen that section; consider demoting the vague Biztoc/central bank item to “Other News.”\n",
      "5) Minor within-section ordering tweaks: lead each section with the most consequential/primary-source items.\n",
      "\n",
      "Structural and formatting issues (what/why/how)\n",
      "- Location: Top line “Authors Sue Apple Over Books3; AI Lobbying Scrutinized; AI Bubble Fears Rise”\n",
      "  • Problem: Not marked as the newsletter title; sections are using # instead of ##, violating the specified markdown structure.\n",
      "  • Actionable edit: Add “# Authors Sue Apple Over Books3; AI Lobbying Scrutinized; AI Bubble Fears Rise” as the first line. Change every section header to use “##”.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Location: Section “AI Power, Policy, and People” (7 items, mixed themes)\n",
      "  • Problem: Overly broad (policy, legal, culture, workplace) and at the maximum size; weakens cohesion.\n",

      "\n",
      "- Location: Section “Agentic AI: Methods and Moves” and “Other News”\n",
      "  • Problem: A core methods/tutorial story sits in “Other News,” while “Agentic AI” is only two items.\n",
      "  • Actionable edit: Move “Anthropic releases nine-chapter Claude prompt engineering tutorial …” from “Other News” into “Agentic AI.”\n",
      "\n",

      "  • Problem: Vague subject (“Central bank”), aggregator source, headline runs long and ends with a period.\n",

Place the Noahpinion and Hinton items after the Bloomberg and valuation pieces.\\n\\n2) Location: Other News → “Central bank flags AI exuberance and monetization hurdles; warns of correction risk”\\n   - Problem: Thematically redundant with markets/bubble items but separated into Other News, weakening coherence.\\n   - Actionable edit: Move this headline into the merged markets section and position it after the valuation/Bloomberg items.\\n\\n3) Location: Power & Policy (ordering)\\n   - Problem: The highest-salience legal item (Apple lawsuit) is third; policy/lobbying context should follow.\\n   - Actionable edit: Reorder within section: 1) Authors sue Apple… 2) OpenAI accused of pressuring nonprofit… 3) Rishi Sunak to advise…\\n\\n4) Location: AI Mania: Bubble, Hedges, Bets (ordering)\\n   - Problem: Mixed priority; fund rotation/Bloomberg piece is more market-moving than general valuation context and single-name items.\\n   - Actionable edit: Reorder: 1) $35 billion fund braces for rotation… (Bloomberg) 2) AI hype fuels valuation fears… (Business Insider) 3) Pros tout barbell portfolios… (Business Insider) 4) Nvidia revenue hits $46.7B… (Motley Fool)\\n\\n5) Location: AI Economy: “AI spending lifts U.S. growth and 2025 stocks; a miss could trigger recession”\\n   - Problem: Belongs in markets/macro with bubble/rotation items; section split creates redundancy.\\n   - Actionable edit: Move into the merged markets section; place after the valuation and fund rotation pieces.\\n\\n6) Location: Power & Policy → “Rishi Sunak to advise Microsoft and Anthropic on AI; ethics panel sets lobbying limits”\\n   - Problem: Slightly wordy; parallelism can improve clarity.\\n   - Actionable edit (headline rewrite): “Rishi Sunak to advise Microsoft, Anthropic on AI; UK ethics panel limits lobbying”\\n\\n7) Location: Power & Policy → “Authors sue Apple, alleging Apple Intelligence trained on pirated Books3 dataset”\\n   - Problem: Slight redundancy (“Apple” repeated twice) and extra words.\\n   - Actionable edit (headline rewrite): “Authors sue Apple, allege Apple Intelligence trained on pirated Books3”\\n\\n8) Location: Gemini Takes the Wheel → “Google trials Gemini computer control for Android apps; adds Gemini to Maps ‘Ask’”\\n   - Problem: Two updates in one headline; phrasing is a bit clunky.\\n   - Actionable edit (headline rewrite): “Google pilots Gemini app control on Android; adds Gemini ‘Ask’ in Maps”\\n\\n9) Location: AI Mania: “Nvidia revenue hits $46.7B; shares up 1,250% in five years; Street sees strong growth”\\n   - Problem: Three clauses and a vague “Street sees.” Can be tighter and more neutral.\\n   - Actionable edit (headline rewrite): “Nvidia revenue hits $46.7B; shares up 1,250% in five years; outlook remains strong”\\n\\n10) Location: Agentic AI: “Anthropic releases nine-chapter Claude prompt engineering tutorial using Google Sheets, covering clarity, roles, and hallucination avoidance; notes Claude 3 Opus offers higher intelligence”\\n   - Problem: Long, multi-clause; stack of specifics slows reading.\\n   - Actionable edit (headline rewrite): “Anthropic posts nine-part Claude prompt tutorial in Google Sheets; covers clarity, roles, hallucinations; notes Claude 3 Opus is more capable”\\n\\n11) Location: Work & Society → “AI companion apps diverge: U.S. targets men, China targets women under differing rules”\\n   - Problem: Opening noun phrase can be tighter; keep focus on divergence.\\n   - Actionable edit (headline rewrite): “AI companions diverge: U.S. targets men, China targets women under differing rules”\\n\\n12) Location: AI Acceleration Arms Race → “Together AI launches ATLAS adaptive inference; claims 4x speed on DeepSeek-V3.1”\\n   - Problem: Minor tightening for rhythm; meaning unchanged.\\n   - Actionable edit (headline rewrite): “Together AI launches ATLAS adaptive inference; claims 4× speed on DeepSeek-V3.1”\\n\\n13) Location: Section density (global)\\n   - Problem: Several sections have only two items (Gemini, Acceleration). While acceptable, merging similar light sections can strengthen pacing.\\n   - Actionable edit: After merging markets, consider leaving Gemini as is (distinct Google product focus) but aim to add one more item next edition or fold into a broader “Product Updates” if it remains at two items consistently. Keep Acceleration separate given distinct infra focus.\\n\\n14) Location: Other News (ordering)\\n   - Problem: Mixed enterprise and macro items; could prioritize enterprise/product updates first for readability.\\n   - Actionable edit: Within Other News, order as: 1) Windows Copilot adds Gmail… 2) Foundation Health raises $20M… 3) AI chat search reshapes discovery… 4) AI‑crypto startups raised $1.9B… 5) Central bank flags AI exuberance… (moved per item 2) 6) AI finds two lunar cave entrances… 7) Quantum computing timeline…\\n\\n15) Location: Title\\n   - Problem: Strong, but “AI Lobbying Scrutinized” is a bit generic compared with specific items.\\n   - Actionable edit (optional): “Authors Sue Apple Over Books3; OpenAI Lobbying Scrutinized; AI Bubble Fears Rise”\\n\\nSection-by-section quality notes:\\n- Power & Policy: Coherent, timely; reorder for impact; minor headline tightening.\\n- Work & Society: Solid mix; headlines clear; one minor rewrite for concision.\\n- Markets (post-merge): Will read stronger as one section; place highest-value (Bloomberg, valuation) first.\\n- Gemini Takes the Wheel: Clear scope; one headline refinement improves clarity.\\n- AI Acceleration Arms Race: Focused and relevant; minor tightening only.\\n- Agentic AI: Strong thematic coherence; trim one long headline.\\n- India AI Rising: Coherent regional snapshot; fine as is.\\n- Other News: Good catch-all; move macro item out; then reorder for readability.\\n\\nWith these edits, the draft moves from good to publish-ready while preserving meaning and sources.'\n",
