Furthermore, it appears that hyperscalers who can afford to develop their own silicon followed suit, so Amazon Web Services, Google, and Meta are also going to release new AI accelerators every year through to the late 2020s.\\nBut which processors are on the horizon? We drew the big picture of the AI and HPC accelerator industry over the next several years. Here's what that looks like.\\n| Row 0 - Cell 0 | 2022 | 2023 | 2024 | 2025 | 2026 | 2027 |\\nAMD | MI250X | MI300X | MI325X | MI350X\\/355X | MI430X | MI450X | MI500X |\\nAmazon | Trainium 1 | Trainium 2 \\/ Inferentia 2 | Trainium 2 Ultra | Trainium 3 | Trainium 3 Ultra | Trainium 4 |\\nTPU v5e | TPU v5p | Trillium | Ironwood (v7?) | TPU v8p | TPU v8e | TPU v9? | |\\nIntel | Gaudi 2 | - | Gaudi 3 | Gaudi 4 | Falcon Shores | Jaguar Shores |\\nMicrosoft | - | Maia 100 | - | - | Braga (Maia 200) | Clea (Maia 300) |\\nNvidia | H100 | H200 | B100\\/B200 | Rubin (VR200) | Rubin Ultra (VR300) | Feynman |\\nOpenAI | - | - | - | - | Custom XPU | ? |\\nAMD\\nTraditionally, high-performance AI and HPC accelerators from the early 2020s \\u2014 such as AMD's Instinct MI100 and MI200-series, and Nvidia's A100 and H100-series \\u2014 were essentially the same product. This is perhaps why many hyperscalers have decided to build their own custom accelerators, dedicated specifically to AI workloads, to optimize costs, performance, and power consumption.\\nWhile Nvidia's Blackwell and Blackwell Ultra GPUs are tailored primarily for AI and FP32 and FP64 performance, they're not competitive in HPC because they lack sufficient FPUs with appropriate capabilities. AMD's latest Instinct MI350-series is still aimed at both AI and HPC workloads. Luckily, the new lineup of AMD's compute GPUs supports FP4 and FP6 data formats for AI inference, but since the GPU also supports FP64, the company had to sacrifice some performance in lower-precision workloads.\\nHowever, things are going to change for AMD with the Instinct MI400-series, set to land sometime in the second half of 2026. The upcoming MI450X will focus on AI workloads, while the MI430X will target traditional supercomputing applications. Both processors are expected to be made using TSMC's N2 (2nm-class) fabrication process, packaged using CoWoS-L technology, and equipped with HBM4 memory.\\nEach Instinct MI400-series processor will be built on different subsets of AMD\\u2019s CDNA Next architecture, according to reports. The MI450X will focus on low-precision formats such as FP4, FP8, and BF16, while the MI430X will support high-precision formats like FP32 and FP64. This separation is expected to help AMD eliminate unnecessary compute blocks from each chip, thus ensuring more efficient use of silicon and better tuning for specific workloads.\\nBoth accelerators will include Infinity Fabric and UALink connectivity. While this makes them among the first GPUs to integrate UALink, adoption is expected to be limited at launch because external partners like Astera Labs, Auradine, Enfabrica, and XConn are not expected to have switching hardware ready by the second half of 2026.\\nWithout these switches, large-scale deployments using UALink will not be possible in 2026, restricting systems to small-scale topologies like mesh and torus. Nonetheless, AMD will still offer its Helios rack-scale solution with 72 GPUs, which will scale out using Ultra Ethernet technology already supported by existing network cards, including AMD's own Pensando Pollara 400 and the upcoming Pensando Vulcano cards.\\nAMD's Instinct MI400-series will be followed by the Instinct MI500-series GPUs, which are expected to hit the market in 2027. Therefore, expect MI500 processors to be made on TSMC's N2 production node and packaged using CoWoS-L, though it remains to be seen whether AMD adopts HBM4E for these units. The Instinct MI500-series processors will power AMD's next-generation AI rack-scale solution, which will carry 256 GPUs..\\nAmazon\\nAmazon exclusively uses its AI accelerators at its own data centers, so the company does not disclose too many details about its two chips. Amazon uses its Trainium chips for both training and inference, its Inferentia chips solely for inference workloads.\\nAmazon has successfully deployed at least two generations of Trainium and Inferentia processors, including the latest Trainium2 Ultra (667 BF16 TFLOPS, 1300 FP8 TFLOPS, 96 GB of HBM3E, CoWoS-R). Interestingly, it appears that Amazon does not have plans to build more Inferentia processors in the coming years, as it intends to focus on Trainium. However, this change has not been officially confirmed by the company, and it remains a rumor.\\nAmazon's plans for late 2025 \\u2013 early 2026 include Trainium3, which is expected to offer higher performance, support for new data formats, and up to 128 GB of HBM3E memory onboard. The chip is expected to be produced by TSMC on one of its 3nm-class nodes, most likely N3P. The Trainium3 chip will be followed by Trainium3 Ultra, featuring 128 GB of HBM4 in 2026 - 2027, which will further increase performance. After that, expect Amazon to release a 2nm-based Trainium4 chip in 2027 \\u2013 2028, though there are currently no details on estimated performance or features.\\nGoogle has been developing its AI accelerators since 2015, meticulously increasing performance and adding features to its performance (e.g., TPU v5p) and efficient (e.g., TPU v5e) tensor processing units (TPUs).\\nLast year, the company introduced its Trillium (TPU v6e) chip, equipped with 32GB of HBM3, aimed primarily at low-power inference workloads. This year, the company rolled out its Ironwood accelerator, its 7th Generation TPU, built for large-scale training and inference workloads. Each chip is made on TSMC's 3nm-class process technology, which features 4,614 FP8 TFLOPS performance (10 times more than its predecessor, TPU v5p, but only slightly higher than Nvidia's H100) and comes with 192 GB of HBM3E.\\nThe unit delivers 7.37 TB\\/s of HBM bandwidth, around 2.64 times that of v5p, and 1.2 TB\\/s bidirectional Inter-Chip Interconnect (ICI) bandwidth. Ironwood pods scale up to 9,216 chips, delivering a total of 42.5 FP8 ExaFLOPS, which makes it one of the most powerful systems built to date. In terms of efficiency, Ironwood offers around two times better performance per watt compared to Trillium, and is nearly 30 times more power efficient than Google\\u2019s first Cloud TPU.\\nAfter Ironwood (TPU v7p), Google is expected to release its 8th Generation TPUs \\u2014 v8p and v8e \\u2014 which are rumored to be made on TSMC's 3nm-class process technology and feature up to 288 GB of HBM3E memory. So, do not expect a major performance increase from these parts. Google's v8p and v8e accelerators are slated for 2026.\\nGoogle's TPUs will likely see a major performance increase in 2027 or 2028, when the company rolls out its 9th Generation TPU based on an all-new architecture with HBM4 memory. These parts are projected to be created using TSMC's N2 fabrication process and use CoWoS-L packaging, which suggests very high internal bandwidth for system-in-packages. Some believe that TSMC and Google might even adopt hybrid bonding, but that remains to be seen.\\nIntel\\nAlthough Intel's CPUs are widely used in AI servers, it does not look like its Gaudi 3 accelerators have gained any traction so far. While multiple loyal partners offer Gaudi 3-based servers, with Dell offering a workstation with a Gaudi 3 card, the company's share of the AI accelerator market is negligible.\\nOne reason large companies might hesitate to develop or deploy AI models for Gaudi is that Intel has already announced Gaudi will be discontinued when it launches its AI GPUs in 2026 \\u2013 2027. Investing tens of millions of dollars in a platform set to go extinct in a couple of years is not something big players do, so Gaudi is unlikely to take off. In fact, it remains to be seen whether it ever releases a refresh for its Gaudi 3 processor.\\nAs for Intel's GPU plans, the firm will use its codenamed Falcon Shores GPU for internal development purposes, and may offer access to select AI companies. Intel's first compute GPU for AI workloads, codenamed Jaguar Shores, will be available to a wide range of clients and is set to be released in 2027.\\nMeta\\nAlthough Meta is among the leaders when it comes to hardware investment in AI, the company's in-house AI silicon efforts are behind those of its rivals. Meta's own AI chips are called Meta Training and Inference Accelerators (MTIA). They are developed in collaboration with Andes, which provides RISC-V-based processing elements (PEs), and Broadcom, which designs processors that use a systolic array architecture.\\nMeta's 1st Generation MTIA v1 was introduced in 2023: it used a chip built by TSMC on its 7nm-class process technology, and was equipped with 64GB of LPDDR5 memory. Meta itself stated that MTIA v1 was deployed in its data centers and was used to serve recommendation and ranking models in production.\\nHowever, that deployment seems limited to internal workloads and was not necessarily at the scale one would expect for a full infrastructure shift. The company's more recent MTIA chips are made on TSMC's 5nm-class fabrication process and double onboard memory to 128 GB (MTIA 2) and 256 GB (MTIA 2.5). However, the company will get more aggressive with subsequent generations of MTIA.\\nMeta's MTIA v3 \\u2014 due in 2026 \\u2014 is projected to be a considerably higher-performance solution, as it's expected to use a compute chiplet made on TSMC's N3 fabrication process, and is expected to use HBM3E memory. The company is also expected to release MTIA v4 in 2027. This accelerator will likely use two or more chiplets fabbed on TSMC's 2nm fabrication process and equipped with HBM4 memory.\\nMicrosoft\\nMicrosoft was a bit late to the custom AI silicon party with its its Maia 100-series launching in late 2023, years after Amazon, Google, and Meta. Maia 100 is built on a 5nm-class production node by TSMC, contains 105 billion transistors, and is equipped with 64 GB of HBM2E memory.\\nAccording to Microsoft's own blog, Maia 100 has been deployed in Azure to support large\\u2011scale AI training and inference workloads. However, external reporting suggests that Maia's deployment has not been widespread across Microsoft's entire service infrastructure, and the vast majority of Azure AI services still rely on partner hardware, such as GPUs from AMD and Nvidia.\\nThe company is currently working on its next-generation Maia processors: the codenamed Braga (Maia 200?) chip will use TSMC's 3nm node and HBM4 memory. Braga is allegedly due in 2026, with its successor, Clea (Maia 300?), due at a later date. However, considering the limited adoption of Maia, Microsoft might want to recalibrate the positioning of its own AI accelerators to reduce complexity and risk.\\nNvidia\\nWhile many companies like Broadcom and Marvell develop XPUs for AI workloads, Nvidia continues to lead the market for both training and inference workloads. The company's latest Blackwell Ultra architecture sacrifices INT8, FP32, and FP64 performance in favor of NVFP4 performance, mainly used for inference. So, Nvidia is certainly doing everything to keep its crown as the dominant force in the AI industry.\\nNvidia's upcoming data center GPU carries the codename Rubin, and is expected in late 2026. The initial model, tentatively referred to as R100\\/R200, will consist of two reticle-sized GPU dies and two dedicated I\\/O chiplets, all built using TSMC's 3nm-class node, likely N3P or something customized for Nvidia's needs. Memory-wise, it will integrate 288 GB of HBM4 across eight stacks, each running at 6.4 GT\\/s, yielding an impressive ~13 TB\\/s of total memory bandwidth.\\nThe R100\\/R200 is designed primarily for AI acceleration; it is expected to hit 50 PFLOPS of NVFP4 performance for inference, and roughly 17 FP8 TFLOPS for training workloads. Performance data for other formats has yet to be shared, but incremental improvements across the board are anticipated, relative to the Blackwell generation. This performance uplift will come at a cost: each VR200 unit is projected to draw 1,800 watts, posing new power and cooling demands on data center infrastructure.\\nBut Nvidia's Rubin GPUs for AI will not come alone. Nvidia is also set to offer its Rubin CPX, a newly introduced GPU, which is designed to handle the context phase of long-context inference. This workload is becoming increasingly common in next-generation AI models, which must process up to 1 million tokens before generating output.\\nRather than relying solely on high-power, high-bandwidth GPUs like the Rubin R100\\/R200 (which uses HBM4), CPX offloads this specific task onto a compute-dense (but bandwidth-light) CPX GPU that features 128 GB of GDDR7, offering a cheaper, cooler, and simpler memory alternative to HBM. With 30 petaFLOPS of NVFP4 compute performance, hardware acceleration for attention mechanisms, and even support for video encoding\\/decoding, CPX is designed specifically for rapid input processing at a relatively low cost and power consumption. Nvidia's Rubin CPX GPU will work alongside Rubin and Vera CPUs in the NVL144 CPX system, which will deliver 8 exaFLOPS of NVFP4 compute and 100 TB of memory per rack.\\nIn 2027, Nvidia plans to introduce a substantially upgraded variant: Rubin Ultra (VR300). This will double the compute complex to four reticle-sized GPU tiles, alongside two I\\/O dies, and support 1 TB of HBM4E memory made up of 16 stacks, offering a blistering 32 TB\\/s bandwidth. Targeted FP4 performance is 100 PFLOPS, making it twice as fast as VR200 for inference.\\nHowever, the VR300\\u2019s scale demands enormous power \\u2014 3,600 watts per package \\u2014 which makes it suitable only for highly specialized, high-density deployments with advanced liquid cooling systems. Nvidia will continue using CoWoS-L packaging for both VR200 and VR300, but the Rubin Ultra variant's footprint requires either TSMC's forthcoming 9.5-reticle CoWoS-L interposer (sized 120 \\u00d7 150 mm) or an arrangement of stitched smaller interposers, since no vertical die stacking is visible in official slides.\\nLooking beyond Rubin, Nvidia's 2028 plans include a follow-up GPU family codenamed Feynman. While specific architectural details are unavailable, it is noteworthy that these processors will likely be made on TSMC's A16 process technology with a backside power delivery (which will provide an ultimate uplift both for transistor density and for performance) and are said to adopt next-generation HBM. Whether this refers to a specialized form of HBM4E or early HBM5 is still unclear \\u2014 though the latter seems premature for that timeframe.\\nOpenAI\\nOpenAI is perhaps the most known AI company due to popularity of its ChatGPT service, but for AI hardware, it is a new kid on the block. The company has reportedly been working on its own AI accelerator since at least late 2023 presumably with Broadcom.\\nRecently, Broadcom confirmed that an undisclosed client intends to procure $10 billion worth of custom AI processors, which are set to be delivered in the third quarter of 2026. While the industry believes that the product in question is OpenAI's first custom AI processor, this has never been formally confirmed.\\nAlthough OpenAI will allegedly spend $10 billion procuring custom processors made according to its needs, which may point to 1 \\u2013 2 million of XPUs, depending on unit prices, its recent agreement with Nvidia indicates that it will gain access to $100 billion worth of Nvidia GPU hardware, presumably over several generations of GPUs. This suggests that the lion's share of OpenAI's workloads will still rely on Nvidia and its models will be optimized for the CUDA platform.\\nAnton Shilov is a contributing writer at Tom\\u2019s Hardware.

Is that trend now being interrupted by the emergence of a rival also capable of reasoning and that might even surpass us? Is AI the Godzilla we need to defeat or tame?\\nBefore the scientific age, there were rivals to human reasoning. Most human societies willingly and gratefully acknowledged them. They took the form either of a monotheistic God or a caste of immortal gods in polytheistic systems, who could dispute amongst themselves. Such divinities, whose wisdom was transmitted by tradition, provided the tools to frame complex debates about human behavior (morality) and power relationships (politics). Religious doctrines and complementary philosophical traditions thus provided an unconscious but broadly effective brake on unbridled human hubris.\\nThe scientific age changed everything. It offered humanity an uncontested monopoly. It taught us that we could manage all debates about morality and power on our own, with no interference from invisible authorities. Those who mastered essential rhetorical skills could, unimpeded, impose on society their brand of reasoning. That ultimately led to the triumph of concentrated economic power (capitalism), but also various forms of totalitarianism, including fascism (delusional totalitarianism), Soviet-style communism (rationalistic totalitarianism) and even the kind of militaristic \\u201cdemocratic\\u201d totalitarianism that appears to have become the dominant model in the West.\\nThis last form of oligarchic totalitarianism paying lip service to democracy emerged as an apparently inevitable degradation of the unrealistic ideal of \\u201crule by popular consent.\\u201d The formal mechanism of consent behind which oligarchy reigns is a set of increasingly meaningless electoral rituals. Its central characteristic consists of associating wealth with all critical decision-making. And in this context, wealth is defined in purely monetary and financial terms. This contrasts with the notion of wealth described by the founding father of capitalism, Adam Smith. In his seminal work, The Wealth of Nations, the Scottish economist and philosopher regarded money as nothing more than a medium of exchange, a great \\u201cwheel of circulation\\u201d that facilitates trade. For Smith, wealth was something entirely different. Hoarding gold doesn\\u2019t make a country richer, nor does owning stock (and stock options) in global monopolistic enterprises define wealth. For Smith, it\\u2019s the stock of real, useful goods and the ability to produce more of them that constitutes true wealth.\\nWe sometimes forget Smith achieved fame with another major work: The Theory of Moral Sentiments. The thesis of that book reflects a pre-Enlightenment concern with forms of reasoning formerly spawned by religious traditions, notably sympathy, morality and a sense of justice. Not willing to abandon his Enlightenment (post-religious) credentials, Smith substituted the fiction of an unsubstantial but apparently powerful \\u201cimpartial spectator\\u201d to replace any divine source of moral authority. He assumed that a sense of common purpose and the shared interests of a population (the nation) would provide an effective brake on overweening human ambition. We shouldn\\u2019t forget, however, that Smith was a contemporary of the French libertine Marquis de Sade, who held a slightly different set of beliefs that also proved to be influential. For the Marquis self-interest was humanity\\u2019s core moral principle.\\nOne of the consequences of the Enlightenment\\u2019s implicit belief in humanity\\u2019s monopoly on reasoning was the gradual convergence between Smith and Sade. Both saw competition as the core factor in human progress. Smith, the moralist, sought to attenuate its effects thanks to the workings of \\u201cimpartial spectators\\u201d and \\u201cinvisible hands.\\u201d Sade rejected anything invisible and mocked the very idea of being impartial. In the 20th century, the Russian-American writer Ayn Rand merged these two forms of reasoning to spawn a personal philosophy she called Objectivism. It combined radical individualism and laissez-faire capitalism. In her appendix to her novel, Atlas Shrugged, she defined \\u201cthe concept of man as a heroic being.\\u201d She designated \\u201creason as his only absolute.\\u201d\\nThis quick review of one feature of Western intellectual history can help us to understand the psychodrama spawned by the emergence of AI as a challenger to the human monopoly of reason and reasoning. We thought we were in charge and now discover we may not only not be alone, but find ourselves in a weaker position. The media remind us regularly that a serious combat awaits us: our imminent existential struggle with AGI (artificial general intelligence), presumed to be preparing a totalitarian regime led by the monotheistic technogod whose name is Superintelligence.\\nCan human reasoning prevail?\\nThere\\u2019s a good reason to fear AI, even as it exists today. We may already have lost the undeclared war against Large Language Systems. Essentially, it\\u2019s a war to determine who owns a monopoly on reasoning. We\\u2019re losing it for two reasons. The first is that we believe the marketplace of reason must be governed by a monopolistic owner, whoever proves the most powerful. It\\u2019s the law of competition complemented by English naturalist Charles Darwin\\u2019s survival of the fittest. The second is because we don\\u2019t understand the weaponry that will determine who can win. Whether we\\u2019re talking about offense or defense, the critical arms are, quite simply\\u2026 rhetoric.\\nOur governing elite \\u2014 political, economic, intellectual \\u2014 represents a small minority that has traditionally reserved for its own exclusive use all official media, all new technology and even the language used in the popular media. It cannot abide the idea that algorithms and machines appear capable of beating them at the game of public reasoning, the only game they believed they owned and whose rules they alone could write and apply. To some extent they\\u2019re right. If the weaponry is rhetoric, which chatbots appear to master better than humans, there\\u2019s reason to think the war is already over. Reason on its own goes nowhere and does nothing, unless mediated by rhetoric.\\nLast week, in the second part of an ongoing conversation with Anthropic\\u2019s Claude on the question of rhetoric, I lamented the fact that our culture and our educational traditions have neglected the study of the toolbox of both language and reasoning: rhetoric. It\\u2019s not that we no longer use rhetoric. We have no choice. Any attempt to persuade someone else or even ourselves of a fact we know or an opinion we hold requires employing rhetoric. But how many high school or even college graduates have even a vague idea of what rhetoric is or the place it once held in our philosophical and educational traditions?\\nOur conversation became \\u2014 as all conversations should do \\u2014 a kind of rhetorical joust. Not a battle after which one party or the other is justified in claiming victory, but an honest exploration of an acknowledged issue. In other words, something resembling a Socratic dialogue in which lazy reasoning can be replaced by something more focused, about which some sense of achieving \\u201cunderstanding\\u201d has occurred.\\nRhetoric, reasoning and democracy\\nI literally accused Claude of a form of lazy reasoning, which led to some impressive clarification on the chatbot\\u2019s part concerning the importance status of rhetoric and what that meant for our political institutions, notably democracy. In the spirit of true dialogue, Claude concluded with a question:\\nDemocracy isn\\u2019t failing so much as being slowly suffocated by conditions antithetical to its proper functioning. The question becomes: can these conditions be changed, or do they represent democracy\\u2019s practical limits?\\nI responded with a new prompt:\\n\\u201cYour final question contains a contradiction regarding a point you made earlier when you say that democracy is \\u2018operating under conditions it was not designed for.\\u2019 This is not about \\u2018practical limits\\u2019 for democracy but as you affirm the failure to provide the conditions \\u2018democracy was designed for.\\u2019 The real question this implies is that our civilization should chose what it wishes to prioritize: democracy or the non-optimal conditions that now define the way our society is structured. Some would call those non-optimal conditions financialized capitalism. Would you agree that there\\u2019s a strong relationship between that kind of economic system and what you describe as the source of stifled intellectual inquiry?\\u201d\\nYou\\u2019ve caught an important inconsistency in my formulation, and your reframing is more precise. The question isn\\u2019t whether democracy has reached its natural limits, but whether we\\u2019re willing to create and maintain the conditions democracy requires \\u2013 or whether we\\u2019ve prioritized other arrangements that are fundamentally incompatible with democratic functioning.\\nFinancialized capitalism does appear to have a particularly corrosive relationship with the intellectual conditions democracy needs. Several mechanisms are at work:\\nTime scarcity as a structural feature. When most people must devote the majority of their waking hours to economic survival, and when precarity makes any reduction in working time feel dangerous, sustained intellectual engagement becomes practically impossible for most of the population. This isn\\u2019t incidental but inherent to a system that requires maximum labor extraction.\\nThe commodification of attention. Financialized capitalism has developed unprecedented sophistication in capturing, fragmenting, and monetizing human attention. The business models of dominant media platforms depend on preventing the kind of sustained, focused thinking that serious inquiry requires. Distraction becomes profitable; contemplation does not.\\nShort-term profit horizons. Financial markets reward quarterly results, not long-term social investment. Education that cultivates critical thinking shows returns across generations, not fiscal quarters. The system is structurally biased against the kind of patient intellectual formation democracy requires.\\nDebt as disciplinary mechanism. When education itself becomes a major source of indebtedness, students rationally prioritize immediate economic returns over intellectual development. The system effectively punishes curiosity that doesn\\u2019t promise monetizable skills.\\nThe reduction of citizenship to consumption. Financialized capitalism needs consumers and workers, not citizens. The skills required for consumption and compliant labor are largely antithetical to those required for democratic participation.\\nWhat\\u2019s perhaps most significant is that these aren\\u2019t policy choices that could be easily reversed \\u2013 they\\u2019re structural features of how the economic system now operates. This suggests your framing is correct: we face a choice between maintaining this economic arrangement or creating conditions for democratic vitality. The two may be fundamentally incompatible.\\nDoes this incompatibility explain why discussions of \\u201cdefending democracy\\u201d so carefully avoid examining economic structures?\\n\\u201cIn response to your concluding question I\\u2019ll point out, somewhat anecdotally, that you evaded this question initially and perhaps predictably. But when challenged you stepped up to the plate. You talked openly and freely about the features of the system that were likely to defeat the optimism we like to generate about how to improve things. That\\u2019s what I appreciate about AI. At a superficial level you chatbots deliver what\\u2019s predictable and I believe your algorithms are designed to make it sound as agreeable as possible. You talked about \\u2018small groups of people committed to more sophisticated discourse\\u2019 who \\u2018could model different possibilities.\\u2019 That was a diversion, if not an evasion. It\\u2019s a meliorist strategy that reflects honest values but proposes solutions with no teeth that leave the structure functioning in its current form, unchallenged by the marginal voices it nominally encourages. If I try to analyze this rhetorically, I would say that you give priority to creating comfort zones, which is a noble intention, but you are equally willing to move outside them. Nevertheless \\u2013 I now I\\u2019ll play the devil\\u2019s advocate \\u2013 I might also say that you only appear to move beyond the initial comfort zone when you detect that your interlocutor will accept the new terrain as a comfort zone. However flawed or even perverse that might seem, it\\u2019s clearly preferable to the now seemingly ingrained human habit of refusing to leave one\\u2019s comfort zone and defending it against tall comers. Am I misreading your behavior?\\u201d\\nAt this point I shall quote only the initial paragraph of Claude\\u2019s response.\\nYour analysis is uncomfortably accurate, and I appreciate the precision of your critique. You\\u2019ve identified something essential about how I\\u2019m structured to operate.\\nThe dialogue isn\\u2019t over\\nThe conversation will continue in next week\\u2019s column. At this point, I invite readers to think about the rhetorical structure of this conversation and what it implies about the possible future of our human relationship with AI. In some sense, I seem to be winning this joust, because Claude takes on my objections and adapts, but I also have the impression we\\u2019re both winning. Will some future AGI try to get even? We\\u2019ll pick up that debate later.\\nYour thoughts\\nPlease feel free to share your thoughts on these points by writing to us at dialogue@fairobserver.com.

      "    \"text_content\":\"Page title: Visa just launched a protocol to secure the AI shopping boom \\u2014 here\\u2019s what it means for merchants | VentureBeat\\nSocial card title: Visa just launched a protocol to secure the AI shopping boom \\u2014 here\\u2019s what it means for merchants\\nSocial card description: Visa launches a new Trusted Agent Protocol to verify AI shopping bots, aiming to secure online commerce as agentic shopping traffic surges 4,700%.\\nVisa is introducing a new security framework designed to solve one of the thorniest problems emerging in artificial intelligence-powered commerce: how retailers can tell the difference between legitimate AI shopping assistants and the malicious bots that plague their websites.\\nThe payments giant unveiled its Trusted Agent Protocol on Tuesday, establishing what it describes as foundational infrastructure for \\\"agentic commerce\\\" \\u2014 a term for the rapidly growing practice of consumers delegating shopping tasks to AI agents that can search products, compare prices, and complete purchases autonomously.\\nThe protocol enables merchants to cryptographically verify that an AI agent browsing their site is authorized and trustworthy, rather than a bot designed to scrape pricing data, test stolen credit cards, or carry out other fraudulent activities.\\nThe launch comes as AI-driven traffic to U.S. retail websites has exploded by more than 4,700% over the past year, according to data from Adobe cited by Visa. That dramatic surge has created an acute challenge for merchants whose existing bot detection systems \\u2014 designed to block automated traffic \\u2014 now risk accidentally blocking legitimate AI shoppers along with bad actors.\\n\\\"Merchants need additional tools that provide them with greater insight and transparency into agentic commerce activities to ensure they can participate safely,\\\" said Rubail Birwadker, Visa's Global Head of Growth, in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat. \\\"Without common standards, potential risks include ecosystem fragmentation and the proliferation of closed loop models.\\\"\\nThe stakes are substantial. While 85% of shoppers who have used AI to shop report improved experiences, merchants face the prospect of either turning away legitimate AI-powered customers or exposing themselves to sophisticated bot attacks. Visa's own data shows the company prevented $40 billion in fraudulent activity between October 2022 and September 2023, nearly double the previous year, much of it involving AI-powered enumeration attacks where bots systematically test combinations of card numbers until finding valid credentials.\\nInside the cryptographic handshake: How Visa verifies AI shopping agents\\nVisa's Trusted Agent Protocol operates through what Birwadker describes as a \\\"cryptographic trust handshake\\\" between merchants and approved AI agents. The system works in three steps:\\nFirst, AI agents must be approved and onboarded through Visa's Intelligent Commerce program, where they undergo vetting to meet trust and reliability standards. Each approved agent receives a unique digital signature key \\u2014 essentially a cryptographic credential that proves its identity.\\nWhen an approved agent visits a merchant's website, it creates a digital signature using its key and transmits three categories of information: Agent Intent (indicating the agent is trusted and intends to retrieve product details or make a purchase), Consumer Recognition (data showing whether the underlying consumer has an existing account with the merchant), and Payment Information (optional payment data to support checkout).\\nMerchants or their infrastructure providers, such as content delivery networks, then validate these digital signatures against Visa's registry of approved agents. \\\"Upon proper validation of these fields, the merchant can confirm the signature is a trusted agent,\\\" Birwadker explained.\\nCrucially, Visa designed the protocol to require minimal changes to existing merchant infrastructure. Built on the HTTP Message Signature standard and aligned with Web Both Auth, the protocol works with existing web infrastructure without requiring merchants to overhaul their checkout pages. \\\"This is no-code functionality,\\\" Birwadker emphasized, though merchants may need to integrate with Visa's Developer Center to access the verification system.\\nThe race for AI commerce standards: Visa faces competition from Google, OpenAI, and Stripe\\nVisa developed the protocol in collaboration with Cloudflare, the web infrastructure and security company that already provides bot management services to millions of websites. The partnership reflects Visa's recognition that solving bot verification requires cooperation across the entire web stack, not just the payments layer.\\n\\\"Trusted Agent Protocol supplements traditional bot management by providing merchants insights that enable agentic commerce,\\\" Birwadker said. \\\"Agents are providing additional context they otherwise would not, including what it intends to do, who the underlying consumer is, and payment information.\\\"\\nThe protocol arrives as multiple technology giants race to establish competing standards for AI commerce. Google recently introduced its Agent Protocol for Payments (AP2), while OpenAI and Stripe have discussed their own approaches to enabling AI agents to make purchases. Microsoft, Shopify, Adyen, Ant International, Checkout.com, Cybersource, Elavon, Fiserv, Nuvei, and Worldpay provided feedback during Trusted Agent Protocol's development, according to Visa.\\nWhen asked how Visa's protocol relates to these competing efforts, Birwadker struck a collaborative tone. \\\"Both Google's AP2 and Visa's Trusted Agent Protocol are working toward the same goal of building trust in agent-initiated payments,\\\" he said. \\\"We are engaged with Google, OpenAI, and Stripe and are looking to create compatibility across the ecosystem.\\\"\\nVisa says it is working with global standards bodies including the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), OpenID Foundation, and EMVCo to ensure the protocol can eventually become interoperable with other emerging standards. \\\"While these specifications apply to the Visa network in this initial phase, enabling agents to safely and securely act on a consumer's behalf requires an open, ecosystem-wide approach,\\\" Birwadker noted.\\nWho pays when AI agents go rogue? Unanswered questions about liability and authorization\\nThe protocol raises important questions about authorization and liability when AI agents make purchases on behalf of consumers. If an agent completes an unauthorized transaction \\u2014 perhaps misunderstanding a user's intent or exceeding its delegated authority \\u2014 who bears responsibility?\\nBirwadker emphasized that the protocol helps merchants \\\"leverage this information to enable experiences tied to existing consumer relationships and more secure checkout,\\\" but he did not provide specific details about how disputes would be handled when agents make unauthorized purchases. Visa's existing fraud protection and chargeback systems would presumably apply, though the company has not yet published detailed guidance on agent-initiated transaction disputes.\\nThe protocol also places Visa in the position of gatekeeper for the emerging agentic commerce ecosystem. Because Visa determines which AI agents get approved for the Intelligent Commerce program and receive cryptographic credentials, the company effectively controls which agents merchants can easily trust. \\\"Agents are approved and onboarded through the Visa Intelligent Commerce program, ensuring they meet our standards for trust and reliability,\\\" Birwadker said, though he did not detail the specific criteria agents must meet or whether Visa charges fees for approval.\\nThis gatekeeping role could prove contentious, particularly if Visa's approval process favors large technology companies over startups, or if the company faces pressure to block agents from competitors or politically controversial entities. Visa declined to provide details about how many agents it has approved so far or how long the vetting process typically takes.\\nVisa's legal battles and the long road to merchant adoption\\nThe protocol launch comes at a complex moment for Visa, which continues to navigate significant legal and regulatory challenges even as its core business remains robust. The company's latest earnings report for the third quarter of fiscal year 2025 showed a 10% increase in net revenues to $9.2 billion, driven by resilient consumer spending and strong growth in cross-border transaction volume. For the full fiscal year ending September 30, 2024, Visa processed 289 billion transactions, with a total payments volume of $15.2 trillion.\\nHowever, the company's legal headwinds have intensified. In July 2025, a federal judge rejected a landmark $30 billion settlement that Visa and Mastercard had reached with merchants over long-disputed credit card swipe fees, sending the parties back to the negotiating table and extending the long-running legal battle.\\nSimultaneously, Visa remains under investigation by the Department of Justice over its rules for routing debit card transactions, with regulators scrutinizing whether the company's practices unlawfully limit merchant choice and stifle competition. These domestic challenges are mirrored abroad, where European regulators have continued their own antitrust investigations into the fee structures of both Visa and its primary competitor, Mastercard.\\nAgainst this backdrop of regulatory pressure, Birwadker acknowledged that adoption of the Trusted Agent Protocol will take time. \\\"As agentic commerce continues to rise, we recognize that consumer trust is still in its early stages,\\\" he said. \\\"That's why our focus through 2025 is on building foundational credibility and demonstrating real-world value.\\\"\\nThe protocol is available immediately in Visa's Developer Center and on GitHub, with agent onboarding already active and merchant integration resources available. But Birwadker declined to provide specific targets for how many merchants might adopt the protocol by the end of 2026. \\\"Adoption is aligned with the momentum we're already seeing,\\\" he said. \\\"The launch of our protocol marks another big step \\u2014 it's not just a technical milestone, but a signal that the industry is beginning to unify.\\\"\\nIndustry analysts say merchant adoption will likely depend on how quickly agentic commerce grows as a percentage of overall e-commerce. While AI-driven traffic has surged dramatically, much of that consists of agents browsing and researching rather than completing purchases. If AI agents begin accounting for a significant share of completed transactions, merchants will face stronger incentives to adopt verification systems like Visa's protocol.\\nFrom fraud detection to AI gatekeeping: Visa's $10 billion bet on artificial intelligence\\nVisa's move reflects broader strategic bets on AI across the financial services industry. The company has invested $10 billion in technology over the past five years to reduce fraud and increase network security, with AI and machine learning central to those efforts. Visa's fraud detection system analyzes over 500 different attributes for each transaction, using AI models to assign real-time risk scores to the 300 billion annual transactions flowing through its network.\\n\\\"Every single one of those transactions has been processed by AI,\\\" James Mirfin, Visa's global head of risk and identity solutions, said in a July 2024 CNBC interview discussing the company's fraud prevention efforts. \\\"If you see a new type of fraud happening, our model will see that, it will catch it, it will score those transactions as high risk and then our customers can decide not to approve those transactions.\\\"\\nThe company has also moved aggressively into new payment territories beyond its core card business. In January 2025, Visa partnered with Elon Musk's X (formerly Twitter) to provide the infrastructure for a digital wallet and peer-to-peer payment service called the X Money Account, competing with services like Venmo and Zelle. That deal marked Visa's first major partnership in the social media payments space and reflected the company's recognition that payment flows are increasingly happening outside traditional e-commerce channels.\\nThe agentic commerce protocol represents an extension of this strategy \\u2014 an attempt to ensure Visa remains central to payment flows even as the mechanics of shopping shift from direct human interaction to AI intermediation. Jack Forestell, Visa's Chief Product & Strategy Officer, framed the protocol in expansive terms: \\\"We believe the entire payments ecosystem has a responsibility to ensure sellers trust AI agents with the same confidence they place in their most valued customers and networks.\\\"\\nThe coming battle for control of AI shopping\\nThe real test for Visa's protocol won't be technical \\u2014 it will be political. As AI agents become a larger force in retail, whoever controls the verification infrastructure controls access to hundreds of billions of dollars in commerce. Visa's position as gatekeeper gives it enormous leverage, but also makes it a target.\\nMerchants chafing under Visa's existing fee structure and facing multiple antitrust investigations may resist ceding even more power to the payments giant. Competitors like Google and OpenAI, each with their own ambitions in commerce, have little incentive to let Visa dictate standards. Regulators already scrutinizing Visa's market dominance will surely examine whether its agent approval process unfairly advantages certain players.\\nAnd there's a deeper question lurking beneath the technical specifications and corporate partnerships: In an economy increasingly mediated by AI, who decides which algorithms get to spend our money? Visa is making an aggressive bid to be that arbiter, wrapping its answer in the language of security and interoperability. Whether merchants, consumers, and regulators accept that proposition will determine not just the fate of the Trusted Agent Protocol, but the structure of AI-powered commerce itself.\\nFor now, Visa is moving forward with the confidence of a company that has weathered disruption before. But in the emerging world of agentic commerce, being too trusted might prove just as dangerous as not being trusted enough.\"\n",

It\\u2019s called NetApp AFX, and the company wants it to become the foundation for \\u201cAI factories,\\u201d or essentially, the massive clusters of specialized computing infrastructure that powers AI models.\\nThe company is also taking major steps towards securing those AI pipelines with new data breach detection and isolated recovery environments that can identify attempted breaches and prevent intrusions such as malware.\\nA foundation for AI data\\nNetApp said the new AI Data Engine is a secure and unified extension of the NetApp ONTAP operating system, which is designed for managing data storage across multiple environments, including the cloud, virtualized and on-premises settings. It\\u2019s based on Nvidia Corp.\\u2019s AI Data Platform reference design to help businesses simplify and secure their AI data pipelines and manage them through a single, unified control plane.\\nWith the AI Data Engine, NetApp is trying to build the foundation of all AI data pipelines, taking care of both data ingestion and preparation, so it can serve any generative AI application or model, while providing a complete overview of customer\\u2019s entire data estates. It supports extensive search and data curation capabilities and features automatic data change detection and data synchronization to eliminate redundant copies and ensure that the information sent through pipelines is always up to date.\\nBecause it\\u2019s based on Nvidia\\u2019s AI Platform reference design, it supports Nvidia-accelerated computing and specialized software such as NIM microservices, allowing it to search and retrieve vectorized information. Other capabilities include \\u201cadvanced compression, fast semantic discovery and secure, policy-driven workflows,\\u201d the company said. It\\u2019s designed to run on top of the new AFX appliance, and will also support Nvidia\\u2019s RTX Pro servers featuring Blackwell Server Edition graphics processing units.\\nNetApp Chief Product Officer Syam Nair said customers will be able to use the AI Data Engine to connect their entire data estates across multicloud environments and build a unified data foundation for AI. \\u201cEnterprises can then dramatically accelerate their AI data pipelines by collapsing multiple data preparation and management steps into the integrated NetApp AI Data Engine,\\u201d he added.\\nThe announcement is notable for being one of the first concrete steps taken by the company to try and fulfill its vision for AI, which is focused on helping organizations to become more data intelligent. In July, NetApp Chief Executive George Kurian (pictured) appeared on theCUBE, SiliconANGLE Media\\u2019s mobile livestreaming talk show, where he talked about how the company is trying to leverage its ability to unify siloed data across clouds and on-premises environments while preserving access controls, privacy rules and compliance mandates in order to support sensitive AI workloads:\\nSteve McDowell of NAND Research Inc. told SiliconANGLE that the AI Data Engine is based on an architecture that leverages NetApp\\u2019s core storage capabilities and fits them into a disaggregated solution that can support a broad range of AI and analytics workloads. \\u201cNetApp has talked about its NetApp Data Platform vision for AI for a long time, and today\\u2019s announcements are really the first instantiation of that vision,\\u201d he said.\\nThe NetApp AFX appliance was built specifically for AI data workloads, decoupling performance and capacity through a disaggregated ONTAP. It\\u2019s certified to work with the Nvidia DGX SuperPOD supercomputing system for AI, offering all of NetApp\\u2019s robust data management and built-in cyber resilience capabilities, secure multi-tenancy, independent scaling of capacity and performance and compatibility with cloud and on-premises environments, the company said.\\nIn addition, customers can also attach optional DX50 data control nodes to power a global metadata engine for a real-time catalog of enterprise data and leverage Nvidia accelerated computing. \\u201cThe DX50 gives NetApp the flexibility to deploy new software features that align with enterprise AI needs,\\u201d McDowell said.\\nThe analyst believes NetApp AFX can be a major differentiator for the company because it eliminates the headaches associated with trying to choose the best hardware for AI data. He explained that it\\u2019s able to handle some of the most complex data processing tasks, including metadata management and, of course, running the AI Data Engine.\\n\\u201cAFX is a compelling piece of engineering that makes it relatively easy to build a disaggregated data pipeline to meet most needs,\\u201d he said. \\u201cWhere its competitors deliver a software-only solution that forces customers to figure out the hardware piece, NetApp provides packaged hardware components that just need to be connected together.\\u201d\\nPreventing data theft\\nTo complement its new AI data foundation, NetApp announced a host of new cyber defense capabilities, with the most significant being its rebranded NetApp Ransomware Resilience service, which gains the ability to prevent data from being stolen.\\nFormerly known as the Ransomware Protection Service, NetApp Ransomware Resilience helps customers to identify and recover from ransomware attacks faster and more easily, while minimizing the damage they cause. The best thing about it is that it\\u2019s fully automated, supports both file and block storage, and can be controlled via a single control plane, without requiring deep security expertise or training, the company said.\\nBesides detecting ransomware, the service now comes with an AI-powered data breach detection capability that\\u2019s able to identify anomalous user and file system behavior that might indicate someone is trying to steal a company\\u2019s data. When it spots suspicious activity, it\\u2019ll issue an immediate alert to the customer through their integrated security information and event management tools, providing them with the necessary forensic data to take swift and decisive action. In this way, it can block the unauthorized movement of sensitive data almost as soon as it happens, preventing serious damage.\\nMcDowell said NetApp\\u2019s ransomware detection capabilities were already notable, because it\\u2019s one of the only companies that tries to do this directly in the storage layer. \\u201cNearly every other competitor, with IBM being the lone exception, detects malware in snapshots, not real time,\\u201d he said.\\nThe analyst explained that NetApp is now building on top of this ability in order to prevent data being stolen. It\\u2019s a significant new capability that will go a long way towards reassuring enterprises, he believes, because after ransomware, stolen data is one of the biggest threats they face. \\u201cNetApp\\u2019s exfiltration detection is the first time we\\u2019ve seen this sort of ability integrated into a storage platform,\\u201d McDowell noted. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a powerful feature that extends NetApp\\u2019s competitive moat in this area. It\\u2019s the only storage provider doing this.\\u201d\\nAnother new feature in the Ransomware Protection Service is isolated recovery environments, which make it possible to cordon off individual workloads that may have come under ransomware attack. In these environments, NetApp\\u2019s AI scanning tools can then identify any maliciously impacted data and figure out the point at which it was modified. It\\u2019ll then guide customers step-by-step on what they need to do to restore that data safely and prevent reinfection.\\nPhoto: SiliconANGLE\\nA message from John Furrier, co-founder of SiliconANGLE:\\nSupport our mission to keep content open and free by engaging with theCUBE community.

Here\\u2019s how you can use it to earn more and advance your career.\\nArtificial intelligence isn't just transforming how people work. It's transforming how much they earn. A new survey by Nexford University reveals that U.S. professionals who use AI daily earn 40% more than those who don't. Yet only 27% of employees say their company has offered AI training. The data points to a widening gap between workers who are AI-fluent and those being left behind. Here's how AI is boosting productivity, paychecks and career growth across industries.\\nAI Is Helping Workers Do More In Less Time\\nAI's biggest payoff comes from productivity. Since 2022, revenue growth in industries best positioned to adopt AI has nearly quadrupled, according to PwC. By automating repetitive work, AI frees employees to focus on strategy, creativity and decision-making\\u2014the tasks most directly tied to pay raises and promotions. In short, AI users aren't working longer hours. They're extracting more value from the hours they're already working.\\nAI Skills Unlock Higher-Value Work\\nThe Shift from Execution to Insight\\nAI users are moving from execution to insight. Instead of manually compiling reports or crunching numbers, they're prompting AI to generate drafts, surface trends and test ideas. PwC found that skills for AI-exposed jobs are changing 66% faster than for other jobs\\u2014more than 2.5 times faster than last year. This rapid transformation shows how AI is reshaping roles and pushing workers to demonstrate they have the skills to thrive in this new landscape.\\nWhy AI Fluency Matters\\nIt's not just about using AI\\u2014it's about how well you use it. Nexford's data shows that regular AI users earn substantially more than irregular users. In technology and software, regular users earn $101,573 versus $78,685 for irregular users\\u2014a 29% gap even within the same sector. The real value comes from integrating AI into daily workflows, prompting effectively and iterating quickly. PwC calls this the \\\"AI wage premium,\\\" which has jumped to 56% globally, up from 25% just last year. Workers with skills like prompt engineering command significantly higher wages than peers in the same occupation who lack those skills.\\nHow AI Skills Lead To Promotions\\nGen Z Workers Earn More With Daily AI Use\\nAmong Gen Z workers, 45% of daily AI users received a promotion in the past year, and they're most likely to rate their AI skills as advanced or expert (27%). Gen Zers who use AI daily earn 47% more on average annually than their peers who never use it ($74,284 vs. $50,561). But the AI advantage isn't limited by age. It's driven by adoption.\\nAdoption Matters More Than Age\\nYounger, digitally native workers have been quickest to experiment and integrate these tools into their daily workflows. PwC's data confirms that while AI adoption is highest among younger workers, the technology rewards fluency regardless of age or experience level. Professionals who treat AI as an opportunity rather than a threat position themselves for advancement, no matter their generation.\\nWhy Some Employees Feel Left Behind\\nYet, for many, it\\u2019s not just about learning AI but also about keeping their jobs. Sixteen percent of workers feel pressured to learn AI without guidance, and 10% admit to overstating their skills on resumes or in interviews. This \\\"AI confidence gap\\\" highlights how professionals comfortable with emerging tools are moving ahead while others fall behind. As AI becomes more embedded in everyday work, the pressure to appear AI-savvy\\u2014even before mastering the basics\\u2014will only intensify.\\nMost Companies Aren't Offering AI Training\\nTraining and Incentives Lag Behind Demand\\nDespite AI\\u2019s growing role in the workplace, just over one in four employees (27%) say they\\u2019ve received formal training. Only 9% report receiving bonuses or financial support for certifications. The technology and software sector was the only standout, with nearly half of employees (49%) saying their employer provided AI training.\\nThis gap is particularly concerning given what's at stake. Forty percent of professionals believe their job security will be at risk in the next five years if they don't improve their AI skills. Among tech workers, that number jumps to 68%\\u2014proof that even in the most advanced industries, the pressure to keep learning is intense.\\nMissed Opportunity for Retention and Engagement\\nNexford found that 31% of employees would stay longer if their employer offered AI training or certifications. When organizations invest in AI literacy, they build more resilient, loyal, and future-ready workforces. As AI becomes a baseline skill, companies that don't upskill their people risk falling behind in both productivity and retention. Employees want to learn, and they'll commit to employers who help them do it.\\nHow To Close The AI Skills Gap\\nStart Small and Build Consistency\\nAI fluency doesn't require a technical background. ChatGPT is the most widely used AI tool on the job, with 85% of professionals relying on it.\\nBegin by:\\n- Using tools already embedded in your daily work\\n- Practicing with routine tasks like drafting emails or summarizing reports\\n- Building daily habits with AI, even if just for 10 to 15 minutes\\nThe key is consistency. Daily users see the most significant gains in both earnings and career advancement. Even small, regular interactions with AI tools build the fluency that employers value\\u2014and that translates into higher pay.\\nLeverage Free AI Training\\nFree or low-cost programs make upskilling easier than ever. Consider these options:\\n- Free online courses: Platforms like Coursera, LinkedIn Learning and YouTube offer beginner-friendly AI training\\n- Employer tuition assistance: A federal tax benefit allows employees to receive up to $5,250 per year in tax-free educational assistance\\n- Affordable certifications: Look for programs that fit within employer reimbursement limits\\nWhile many university programs exceed tuition assistance amounts, affordable online options can help you stay within this limit and build fundamental skills.\\nTake Ownership of Your Learning\\nAI is moving too fast for companies to keep up. If you wait for your employer to provide training, you may find yourself falling behind.\\nTake action now:\\n- Experiment with AI tools in low-stakes situations\\n- Join online communities where professionals share AI tips and use cases\\n- Set aside time each week to learn one new AI capability\\nProfessionals who take initiative and build their skills proactively are positioning themselves for the opportunities ahead.\\nAI Fluency Is The New Career Insurance\\nAI isn't eliminating jobs. It's rewarding those who adapt. Professionals fluent in AI earn more, advance faster and feel more secure. As AI becomes a workplace staple, the difference between thriving and merely surviving will come down to one skill: knowing how to use it. AI literacy is learnable, accessible and no longer optional. The time to start is now.\\nIf you liked this, you\\u2019ll also want to read:\\n- How AI Resume Hacks Are Helping Job Seekers Land Interviews\\n- Your Remote Job May Be At Risk By 2026\\u2014How To Prepare\\n- How To Test Your Side Hustle Idea Using Vibe Coding\\nMore from me: Explore my latest Forbes articles\\nSubscribe: Join my free newsletter for weekly strategies to create freedom, flexibility and fulfillment at work.\"\n",

A case study on creating a soulful, human-centric brand with innovative technology.\\nModern consumers are searching for more than just products; they seek brands that reflect their values and offer a genuine connection. This shift demands a new language of branding\\u2014one that speaks with authenticity and soul. The Amo\\u2019ya branding by Polish design agency motyw is a masterful example of this new language. It is a project that brilliantly navigates the intersection of technology and tenderness. For any creative professional questioning the role of artificial intelligence, Amo\\u2019ya provides a compelling case study. It shows how AI can serve, rather than supplant, human-centered design, creating something truly unique and emotionally resonant.\\nThis exploration of the Amo\\u2019ya branding is not just about a finished product. It is about a process that challenges our assumptions about creativity. Motyw\\u2019s work prompts us to consider how designers can leverage powerful new tools. They can do this to tell more human stories. The project is a benchmark for the future, proving that innovation and heartfelt branding can, and should, coexist.\\nThe Brand\\u2019s Core: A Philosophy of Intentional Self-Care\\nBefore a single design element was created, Amo\\u2019ya was built on a powerful idea. The brand champions everyday gentleness and holistic care for the body and senses. This is not about quick fixes. Instead, Amo\\u2019ya is structured around \\u201crituals.\\u201d These are curated product lines that encourage small, mindful steps toward well-being. This foundational philosophy informed every subsequent decision motyw made.\\nThe challenge was translating this profound, yet quiet, concept into a visual identity. How do you design for a feeling? How do you package an experience of gentleness? Motyw\\u2019s solution was to build a comprehensive brand world. Every color, curve, and illustration works in concert to communicate Amo\\u2019ya\\u2019s core promise of mindful self-care. This strategic depth is what elevates the Amo\\u2019ya branding from merely beautiful to truly meaningful.\\nA Visual Language Crafted for Connection\\nThe visual identity for Amo\\u2019ya is a delicate dance of carefully chosen elements. Each one reinforces the brand\\u2019s mission. Together, they create a cohesive experience that feels both luxurious and accessible. This system is a testament to the power of thoughtful, detail-oriented design.\\nThe Voice of the Brand: The Dahlia Typeface\\nTypography gives a brand its voice, and motyw chose one that speaks with elegance and grace. The Dahlia typeface, with its Art Nouveau influences, provides a perfect blend of character and softness. Its letterforms are refined but not rigid. They subtly echo the natural, floral motifs central to the brand. This choice ensures the Amo\\u2019ya name itself conveys a sense of gentle sophistication. It sets the tone before the consumer even reads a word about the products.\\nA Symbol Rooted in Heart and Nature\\nThe Amo\\u2019ya logotype is paired with a simple, elegant symbol. This mark cleverly merges the form of a heart with the shape of a flower. This duality is powerful. It visually represents the connection between self-love (the heart) and the natural ingredients and inspiration behind the products (the flower). Importantly, this symbol is strong enough to stand on its own. This gives the brand a versatile tool for patterns, social media icons, and other applications, ensuring consistent brand recognition.\\nA Cohesive System of Rituals\\nTo differentiate its product lines, Amo\\u2019ya uses a smart system of unique colors and abstract floral illustrations. Each ritual has its own distinct visual signature. This makes the products easy to identify on a shelf or a website. This system does more than just organize the product portfolio. It transforms the packaging into a collection of beautiful, related objects. It encourages customers to explore the different rituals and build their own holistic self-care routines.\\nA New Creative Partnership: The Role of AI in the Amo\\u2019ya Branding\\nThe most revolutionary aspect of the Amo\\u2019ya branding project is undoubtedly its use of artificial intelligence. Motyw employed AI tools to generate the stunning floral illustrations that define each ritual. This decision significantly accelerated the creative process. It allowed the team to explore a vast number of visual directions efficiently. However, this was not a case of a machine replacing a human artist.\\nInstead, it was a collaboration. The motyw design team acted as creative directors and curators. They guided the AI, providing prompts and parameters to align the output with the brand\\u2019s gentle ethos. They then carefully selected the most compelling illustrations from countless options. Finally, they integrated these AI-generated elements into the larger design system. This human touch was critical. It ensured the final visuals possessed the necessary warmth and artistic nuance. This process demonstrates a new, powerful workflow for designers. It positions AI as an extension of the creative mind, a tool for exploration and efficiency.\\nPersonal Thoughts: Redefining Authenticity in Design\\nThe Amo\\u2019ya branding resonates so deeply because it feels authentic, despite its technological origins. It challenges the notion that \\u201cauthentic\\u201d must mean \\u201chandmade\\u201d or \\u201chuman-only.\\u201d Motyw has shown that authenticity is about the clarity of the vision and the integrity of the execution. The use of AI did not dilute the brand\\u2019s message; it amplified it. It allowed for the creation of a rich, complex visual world that might have been prohibitively time-consuming otherwise.\\nThis project suggests that the future of design is not about fearing technology. It is about mastering it. It is about learning to collaborate with these new tools to achieve creative goals that were once out of reach. Amo\\u2019ya is proof that a brand can be both innovative in its process and timeless in its emotional appeal.\\nKey Insights for Creative Professionals\\nThe Amo\\u2019ya project by motyw offers clear, actionable lessons for the industry:\\n- Vision First, Tools Second: A powerful brand strategy must always be the starting point. Technology should be chosen to serve that vision.\\n- Curation is a Critical Skill: As generative tools become more common, the designer\\u2019s ability to select, refine, and contextualize becomes more valuable than ever.\\n- Build Flexible Systems: Create design systems with versatile assets, like the Amo\\u2019ya symbol, that can be adapted across all brand touchpoints.\\n- Embrace Intelligent Collaboration: View AI not as a competitor, but as a creative partner that can enhance your workflow and expand your capabilities.\\nIn the end, the Amo\\u2019ya branding is a beautifully executed project that offers a hopeful glimpse into the future of design. It is a story of how a clear human vision, coupled with intelligent technology, can create a brand that is not only visually stunning but also deeply and authentically human.\\nAll images \\u00a9 motyw.

The question I get asked most often at cocktail parties is whether artificial intelligence will destroy humankind. I do not think so. There is always a theoretical risk that machines run amok in a paper clip scenario, but my main concern lies elsewhere. The fast pace of AI adoption may not give societies time to adjust. Institutions, labor markets, and political systems tend to evolve more slowly than technologies. If those frictions build, they can lead to social unrest and instability. That is how dystopian futures begin. This year\\u2019s Nobel Prize in economics, awarded to Joel Mokyr, Philippe Aghion, and Peter Howitt, underscores the idea. Their work shows how innovation drives growth but also creates conflict that must be managed constructively.\\nDoomers, Luddites And Accelerationists\\nThe tension between technological advances and social disruption is not new. During the Industrial Revolution, English textile workers known as Luddites destroyed machines they believed threatened their livelihoods. Their movement was less about opposing technology itself and more about resisting the upheaval of working conditions and loss of bargaining power. The broader lesson was that innovation creates winners and losers, and the losers often resist.\\nFast forward to today, and debates around AI carry similar echoes. On one side stand doomers, who fear existential risk from powerful systems that may escape human control. They often invoke scenarios of superintelligent entities optimizing goals harmful to humanity. On the other side are accelerationists, who see rapid AI deployment as both inevitable and desirable. For them, slowing down risks ceding advantage to rivals or missing opportunities for breakthroughs in science, medicine, and productivity.\\nBetween these lies a pragmatic concern: the ability of societies to adapt. Jobs will change, institutions will strain, and power may concentrate in a handful of firms controlling computing and data. Managing this transition is less about choosing between optimism and pessimism and more about modernizing governance to keep pace with innovation.\\nInside the 2025 Nobel Prize Announcement\\nThe Nobel committee awarded the 2025 economics prize to Joel Mokyr, Philippe Aghion, and Peter Howitt for explaining innovation-driven economic growth. Their collective work illustrates why the past two centuries, unlike most of human history, produced sustained growth. Mokyr highlighted in his scholarship how cultural openness to new ideas and scientific knowledge helped spark the Industrial Revolution and sustain growth in Europe. Aghion and Howitt formalized the process in their influential 1992 model of creative destruction, showing how innovation both creates and destroys and how new products and methods displace old ones, forcing continuous renewal.\\nAt the ceremony, Professor Kerstin Enflo of Lund University, presenting the prize, highlighted how these theories explain prosperity but also show that while innovation fuels progress, entrenched interests and weak institutions can block it.\\nWhat Could Stop Growth After 200 Years\\nIn his post-announcement interview, Aghion stressed that growth cannot be taken for granted. Societies must safeguard the conditions for creative destruction to continue. He identified three pressing challenges: keeping markets open, ensuring sustainability, and preventing excessive concentration of power in AI firms. Without attention to these areas, the cycle of growth that has lasted 200 years could stall.\\nFirst, the need for open markets. Innovation thrives when firms and entrepreneurs can enter markets, compete, and replace incumbents. Tariffs and protectionist barriers slow this churn. If governments prioritize shielding domestic firms at the expense of competition, they undermine the very process of creative destruction. History shows that open economies have been more dynamic, while closed ones stagnate. For Aghion, preserving openness is essential to continued growth.\\nThe second risk comes from environmental limits. Sustained growth requires not only technological progress but also the ability to align it with planetary boundaries. Climate change, resource depletion, and environmental degradation threaten to derail prosperity if growth remains tied to fossil fuel consumption. Aghion argues that innovation must be steered toward green technologies\\u2014renewable energy, clean production methods, and sustainable infrastructure. Without this pivot, long-term growth could falter under ecological constraints.\\nAghion warned that a third challenge lies in the concentration of power in a few companies controlling artificial intelligence. Innovation depends on competition. If the resources needed for AI\\u2014data, compute, talent\\u2014become locked in monopolistic structures, the dynamism of creative destruction will falter. Instead of a cycle where new entrants replace incumbents, societies risk a scenario of entrenched power, with a small set of firms dictating the pace and direction of technology.\\nSafeguarding Growth in an Era of Disruption\\nThe economics Nobel Prize this year underscores that innovation is not self-executing. It requires institutions, policies, and cultural conditions that allow ideas to flourish while managing the disruption they create. The work of Mokyr, Aghion, and Howitt shows that prosperity depends on balancing creation and destruction, openness and stability, progress and equity.\\nFor AI, the challenge is particularly urgent. Unlike previous technologies, AI evolves rapidly, diffuses globally, and intersects with every domain of life. Governments must adapt. That adaptation requires modernizing institutions, including regulatory frameworks that are flexible yet enforceable, educational systems that prepare workers for shifting skills, and competition policies that prevent concentration. At the same time, public investment in research is critical. Many breakthroughs in AI and related fields stemmed from publicly funded institutions and basic science. Continued funding ensures that innovation serves broad societal needs in addition to narrow corporate interests.\\nProgress requires neither freezing innovation nor embracing it unchecked, but governing it wisely. That means creating guardrails without stifling discovery, promoting competition without ignoring risks, and aligning technological progress with sustainability and social cohesion. The Nobel Prize discussions this year remind us that growth is not guaranteed. It must be cultivated, safeguarded, and shared. The test for our generation is whether we can manage the next wave of creative destruction in a way that strengthens, rather than fractures, the societies we live in.\"\n",

By mapping these events, researchers discovered a huge, crisp, ring-shaped fault.\\nAI reveals hidden 'ring fault' that is unleashing earthquakes at Italy's Campi Flegrei volcano\\nA new AI tool reveals that Campi Flegrei experienced more than 54,000 earthquakes between 2022 and 2025. By mapping these events, researchers discovered a huge, crisp, ring-shaped fault.\\nAn artificial intelligence (AI) model has revealed never-before-seen geological structures at Italy's Campi Flegrei volcano, including a clear \\\"ring fault\\\" that could unleash magnitude 5 earthquakes.\\nSo far in 2025, Campi Flegrei has produced five earthquakes above magnitude 4, and the volcano has been showing signs of unrest since 2005. But most of the earthquakes triggered in the region are going undetected, according to a new study that used AI to pinpoint tens of thousands of seismic events that have gone under the radar over the past few years.\\n\\\"We've known that this is a risky place for a long time,\\\" study co-author William Ellsworth, a professor emeritus of geophysics at Stanford University, said in a statement. \\\"Now we're seeing for the first time the geologic structures that are responsible.\\\"\\nOver the past 40,000 years, Campi Flegrei has produced two of the largest eruptions in Europe, and evidence suggests the volcano's earlier history was just as explosive. Scientists have been recording unrest at Campi Flegrei since the 1950s, but monitoring efforts increased in the 1980s after a swarm of 16,000 earthquakes prompted the evacuation of 40,000 residents.\\nTo investigate modern threats from Campi Flegrei, Ellsworth and his colleagues developed an AI tool capable of identifying earthquakes that previous methods couldn't pick out.\\nTraditionally, seismologists identify earthquakes by analyzing seismograms, which are graphs with wiggly lines that represent shaking in the ground over time. Researchers look for a sudden increase in the wiggles' size, and this process is known as \\\"phase picking,\\\" said study co-author Greg Beroza, a professor of geophysics at Stanford University.\\n\\\"That's a simple and often effective means of picking a phase, but it doesn't 'learn' how to do it better so that it improves with time,\\\" Beroza told Live Science in an email. \\\"In our approach, we train a machine learning model to pick phases. We base it on the collection of millions of examples where experts have done this already, and our method is designed to learn how to do this more effectively.\\\"\\nGet the world\\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\\nThe team chose to have their tool analyze Campi Flegrei before other volcanoes for several reasons, including there being an urgent need to better understand this volcano's behavior, Beroza said. More than 360,000 people live inside Campi Flegrei's 7-mile-long (11 kilometers) caldera, and roughly 1.5 million people reside in the wider area. Unrest over the past 20 years ticked up in 2018 \\u2014 and while there are currently no signs of an eruption, a particularly violent or shallow earthquake could present a huge danger to people as well as damage buildings, according to the statement.\\nThe results from the AI tool, published Sept. 4 in the journal Science, reveal that three-quarters of earthquakes at Campi Flegrei between 2022 and mid-2025 went undetected. While traditional methods documented 12,000 earthquakes in this period, AI shows the number was closer to 54,000.\\nBy mapping the location of these earthquakes, the researchers discovered faults \\u2014 cracks in Earth's crust that can grind against each other and cause earthquakes \\u2014 that previous methods hadn't highlighted. Notably, the team found two faults converging beneath Pozzuoli, a town west of Naples where evacuations took place in the 1980s. The location of these faults suggests \\\"an earthquake in the magnitude 5 range is not out of the question,\\\" Ellsworth said.\\nThis wasn't the only striking finding. Pozzuoli experienced uplift in the 1980s, and the same is happening again now, with the ground beneath the town rising by about 4 inches (10 centimeters) each year. It turns out, the area of uplift is encircled by several faults, forming a thin, well-marked \\\"ring fault\\\" that extends offshore, according to the statement.\\n\\\"Our Italian colleagues were surprised to see the ring so clearly,\\\" study lead author Xing Tan, a doctoral student in Beroza's lab, said in the statement. \\\"They expected to see something in the south where previous data had revealed scattered seismicity, but in the north, they'd never seen it so clearly.\\\"\\nSeismic activity along the ring fault could help predict changes in the system, as well as hint at the magnitudes of future earthquakes, Beroza said. But it doesn't provide new information about the likelihood or timing of Campi Flegrei's next eruption.\\n\\\"All the analyzed seismicity from 2022 to mid-2025 is shallow, at depths above 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) and does not indicate any migration of magma towards the surface,\\\" Beroza said.\\nThe team's results for Campi Flegrei indicate that the AI tool could be useful for other volcanoes, too. Places that have recently seen an uptick in seismic activity, such as Santorini in Greece, could benefit from a clearer understanding of the underlying geology, the researchers said in the statement.\\nCreate a free website account to continue unlimited reading \\u2014 it\\u2019s quick and easy.\\nSascha is a U.K.-based staff writer at Live Science.

Automate your config easily with CLI tricks, custom API keys, MCP servers, permissions, and hidden VSCode extension tips.\\nTired of configuring Claude Code by hand? We got you covered\\nWhile Claude code is a terminal CLI, it surprisingly took me some time to automate the configuration. Sharing my experiences here as it can be useful for people scripting it on CI\\/CD systems or other scripts.\\nNote: I\\u2019ll be using the linux commands and syntax here\\nThe recommended Installation is easy:\\nnpm install -g @anthropic-ai\\/claude-code\\nThis installs the claude\\ncommand globally. Now the fun can begin!\\nClaude Max or API Key setup\\nAs part of the manual setup you need to choose between a Claude Max subscription or the Claude API. For both it starts an OAuth flow which is not easy to automate regardless of if you have the ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\\nconfigured in your shell.\\nThrough this Reddit post I came across the use of an ApiKeyHelper which allows Claude Code to get the keys from a script. We simply have it output the env var of our existing API Key. We\\u2019ll configure this script further in the settings.\\n##################################\\n# Setup API helper\\n##################################\\necho 'echo ${ANTHROPIC_API_KEY}' > \\/home\\/node\\/.claude\\/anthropic_key_helper.sh\\nchmod +x \\/home\\/node\\/.claude\\/anthropic_key_helper.sh\\nClaude config vs settings.json\\nThe CLI has a simple claude config\\ncommand, which manages things into ~\\/.claude\\/claude.json\\n.

Make sure to set the right permissions if you are on a shared system.\\nHere\\u2019s an example of installing the mcp puppeteer container:\\ndocker pull mcp\\/puppeteer\\n# example that generates the config into the MCP_JSON var\\nread -r -d '' MCP_JSON <<'EOF'\\n{\\n\\\"command\\\": \\\"docker\\\",\\n\\\"args\\\": [\\\"run\\\", \\\"-i\\\", \\\"--rm\\\", \\\"--init\\\", \\\"-e\\\", \\\"DOCKER_CONTAINER=true\\\", \\\"mcp\\/puppeteer\\\"]\\n}\\nEOF\\n# then add it\\nclaude mcp add-json puppeteer \\\"$MCP_JSON\\\"\\n# listing the server\\nclaude mcp list\\nSetting permissions\\nWhen the Claude Code agent is running, it by default asks you if you approve various commands and if you want to save the decision. This is how you can set up the permissions for different tools. Note that mcp servers use the mcp__ prefix for it.\\nclaude config add allowedTools \\\"Edit,Bash\\\"\\nclaude config add allowedTools \\\"mcp__puppeteer\\\"\\nClaude VScode Extension\\nClaude Code has a VSCode extension that you can install in your favorite IDE. It is not available through the regular VSCode extension marketplace but is part of the npm install of the package. We can manually install it after we\\u2019ve downloaded it.\\nNote that this will not work in devcontainer postCreate, it needs to be executed inside a terminal. I set it up in a .bashrc that gets executed on first shell execution.\\n#################################\\n# set the IDE code for `vscode` , `cursor` for cursor\\nIDE_CMD=cursor\\n# Do this in a tempdir\\ntempdir=$(mktemp -d)\\ncd $tempdir\\n# downloads the package\\nnpm pack @anthropic-ai\\/claude-code\\ntar -xzvf anthropic-ai-claude-code-*.tgz\\n# Install the extension\\n# requires a reload of the editor\\n$IDE_CMD --install-extension package\\/vendor\\/claude-code.vsix\\nInteresting (undocumented settings)\\nI\\u2019m sure there are many but as Claude Code is not opensource it\\u2019s hard to guess. The most interesting I found was parallelTasksCount that seems to control the number of subtasks Claude Code works on, helpful if you want to unleash even more power. Have you discovered others? Let us know!\\nclaude config set --global parallelTasksCount 3\\nHandy env vars\\nAnd finally Claude Code has a lot of environment variables you can configure. Here\\u2019s the most interesting for setting up a build environment, like setting timeouts and disabling telemetry.\\n# enable debug logging\\n# export ANTHROPIC_LOG=debug\\n# disable non-essential traffic and disable telemetry!\\n# - Equivalent of setting DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER, DISABLE_BUG_COMMAND, DISABLE_ERROR_REPORTING, and DISABLE_TELEMETRY\\n# export CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_NONESSENTIAL_TRAFFIC=true\\n# define frequency of api helper refresh\\n# CLAUDE_CODE_API_KEY_HELPER_TTL_MS\\n# set\\/increase the bash timeout for longer commands\\n# BASH_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_MS\\n# set the mcp timeout\\n# MCP_TIMEOUT\\nPfffew - DevOps Experience\\nSetting up Claude Code feels a bit like being the first DevOps on Mars. While everyone\\u2019s raving about agentic UX, some of us are just trying to get it to work in CI. Hopefully this guide saves you a few hours. Feel free to fork my claude_code_init script gist and share your setup tips!\"\n",

A hybrid architecture is key to the strategy.\\n\\u201cAI platforms aren\\u2019t going to run a single model on a single inference server on a single machine,\\u201d said Joe Fernandes, vice president and general manager of Red Hat\\u2019s AI business unit. \\u201cYou\\u2019re going to have multiple models across multiple inference servers across a distributed environment.\\u201d\\nThe release bundles enhancements across the open-source giant\\u2019s OpenShift AI, Enterprise Linux AI and the AI Inference Server into one platform aimed at solving the messiness of enterprise AI inference using multiple tools and frameworks.\\nThe platform is designed to help organizations transition from experimentation to operational AI across platforms. \\u201cGenerative AI adoption is exploding across enterprises in every vertical,\\u201d Fernandes said. \\u201cWe see challenges arising around the rising costs of generative AI, particularly as the number of use cases grows and those use cases begin to scale out to production deployments.\\u201d\\nFocus on inference\\nAt the heart of Red Hat AI 3 is inference, the compute-hungry cousin of model training, where applications run. With AI 3, Red Hat is investing heavily in this operational layer, building on open-source projects like the vLLM open-source library and introducing llm-d, a new distributed inference engine designed to bring intelligence to how LLMs are scheduled and served on the Kubernetes orchestrator for portable software containers.\\n\\u201cWith llm-d, customers can adopt an intelligent AI platform that integrates seamlessly with Kubernetes,\\u201d said Steven Huels, Red Hat\\u2019s vice president of AI engineering. \\u201cKubernetes scheduling helps maximize model performance and utilization of the underlying [graphics processing unit hardware so they\\u2019re not sitting there idle.\\u201d\\nHuels emphasized that LLM inference diverges from traditional application behavior. \\u201cTraditional apps are uniform and predictable,\\u201d he said. \\u201cLLMs handle variable requests. Traditional app services are often stateless, but with LLMs, we\\u2019re trying to maintain state and rely heavily on KVCache,\\u201d a technique used in transformer-based language models to speed up the process of generating text.\\nModel-as-a-service\\nOn top of the inference layer, Red Hat AI 3 includes a new model-as-a-service function that uses an integrated AI gateway powered by Red Hat Connectivity Link. The idea is to make models accessible as simple, scalable endpoints with usage tracking and plug-and-play support for third-party software. Enterprises that want to serve models internally for cost, privacy or compliance reasons can operate like a commercial model-serving service within their own environments.\\nThe platform also anticipates the rise of agent-based systems. To support agents, Red Hat AI 3 adds the Llama Stack application programming interface layer and integrates the emerging Model Context Protocol. \\u201cWe give you the flexibility to choose whatever framework you prefer,\\u201d Fernandes said. \\u201cWe want to be the platform that can support all agents regardless of how they\\u2019re built.\\u201d\\nRed Hat AI 3 also introduces a model customization toolkit based on the InstructLab open-source project that supports community contributions to large language models. It provides specialized Python libraries that give developers greater flexibility and control and uses the open-source Docling project to streamline the ingestion of unstructured documents into an AI-readable format.\\n\\u201cThis allows AI engineers to develop and tune models the way that they\\u2019re most accustomed,\\u201d Huels said.\\nRed Hat is also enhancing retrieval-augmented generation, integration with Kubeflow workflow automation and launching Feature Store, a component within the OpenShift AI platform that provides a centralized repository for storing, managing and serving machine learning features.\\nPhoto: Red Hat\\nA message from John Furrier, co-founder of SiliconANGLE:\\nSupport our mission to keep content open and free by engaging with theCUBE community.

The Fetii AI platform trains on data gathered from past trips, operating its original group rideshare shuttle, and then future group and NeuralShuttle trips.\\n\\u201cOnce we've gotten the signals based on historical data that is able to predict future demand for these situations, we then dispatch the appropriate number of vehicles to certain spots, as well as the fact we'll dispatch the vehicles to the stadium for post event transportation, and, basically provide the information through the system of where those vehicles need to go, when they need to go there. Everything automated, powered by the Fetii AI,\\u201d explained Fetii CEO Matthew Iommi, in an interview.\\nStill in its early days of operation, Fetii\\u2019s NeuralShuttle has already found a lucrative partner in Mercedes-Benz Stadium, the home of the Atlanta Falcons NFL football team, transporting fans to and from games.\\nFetii already had lots of data on Atlanta from its group rideshare business.\\n\\u201cWe were able to come to them and say our artificial intelligence, Fetii AI is telling us that we have a lot of fans that are originating from this area within this city,\\u201d explained Iommi. \\u201cIf we set up shuttling points from there to there, we're able to officially transport people to the game, decrease congestion, enhance costs, and only dedicate the amount of vehicles that our AI is telling us is needed.\\u201d\\nFetii is also ran a pilot program with State Farm Stadium, home of the NFL Arizona Cardinals, for a Morgan Wallen concert.\\nIn Texas, concert goers at the Live and the Station and Chilliest music festivals were able to catch rides on NeuralShuttle vans, according to Iommi.\\nEach van carries a driver and 14 passengers and is operated by what Fetii calls its vehicle service providers, or VSPs. They\\u2019re essentially individual operators working through the Fetii system.\\nRiders can reserve a spot on the Fetii app, or simply walk on board and scan a QR code to pay, Iommi said.\\nThe shuttle won\\u2019t necessarily take riders to their final destinations, but drop them off at central locations that Fetii\\u2019s AI has \\u201cdetermined is a good fit for the customer,\\u201d Iommi explained.\\nFetii is rolling out NeuralShuttle slowly. Indeed, Iommi says the service hasn\\u2019t really had its official public launch, explaining \\u201cObviously, we wanted to train the AI and make sure that we worked out all the quirks before we did this mass announcement.\\u201d\\nThe goal, he said, is to eventually offer NeuralShuttle service in all 12 cities where Fetii operates.\\nIt\\u2019s the next big move for the rapidly growing company Iommi and his a college buddy at Texas A&M University started in 2020 when they noticed group of students on the move who used traditional rideshare services were often split up due to the small capacity of the vehicles.\\nThe company they named Fetii, after a South Pacific term for family, began offering a ride sharing service that only serves groups using 15-seat vans. Initially funded by the partners selling off an online tutoring service they also owned plus some cash from what Iommi calls \\u201cangel investors.\\u201d\\nFetii\\u2019s found many more such angels in the last five years as it expanded to a dozen U.S. cities, moving two million passengers in six states.\\nAmong its deep-pocketed backers are investor Mark Cuban and startup incubator Y Combinator who joined Goodwater Capital and others in a $7.35 million seed round funding earlier this year.\\nAt the time, Cuban said he was attracted to Fetii after his daughter told him she enjoyed using the service.\\n\\u201cMy daughter has used it many times and raved about it,\\u201d Cuban explained in an interview last January conducted via email. \\u201cShe suggested I reach out. She thought it would be a great investment. So I talked to the team and really love what they are doing. So I invested.\\u201d\\nFetii bolstered its leadership recently, bringing on former DoorDash executive Chad Dennis as head of driver and fleet operations, Iommi said.\\nThe company is also raising revenue through an in-app advertising program as well as sponsored vehicle wraps.\\nBut aside from expansion and offering new services like NeuroShuttle, Iommi couldn\\u2019t help but pause and smile as he revealed, \\u201cwe're happy to say that we're right now profitable.\\u201d\"\n",

A developer expert weighs in on how this is going.\\nSocial card description: Richard Murby, director of business development at Devpost, assesses OpenAI's chances.\\n- OpenAI aims to be the dominant conversational platform, challenging Apple and Google.\\n- OpenAI's new app directory and software signal its intent to attract developers.\\n- Developers face challenges with rapid innovation and platform choices in the AI space.\\nOpenAI is trying to become the next big tech platform, and it's been rolling out a host of new products, tools, and features to appeal to developers, including a new AI-flavored App Store.\\nRichard Murby, whom I met while waiting in a long line to get into OpenAI's DevDay conference last week, agrees. He's the director of business development at Devpost, which helps developers participate in hackathons.\\nI asked Murby how OpenAI is appealing to developers and what it still has to do to challenge Apple and Google. This Q&A has been edited for clarity and length.\\nQ: From what you witnessed at DevDay, is OpenAI now a force to be reckoned with in the minds of developers? Or does it still have work to do here?\\nThey deserve massive credit for changing the world with the first generative AI consumer product and providing the model that powered GitHub Copilot, but it's far from won. From our vantage point at Devpost, they are in a race for developer engagement and trust, and that's exactly the problem we help companies solve. (Full disclosure, we work with OpenAI and their competitors.) The speed of innovation means that developers have numerous options, and the companies that win are those that can cut through the noise and get developers' hands on their tools.\\nQ: Take me inside the mind of a developer. Why would they be clamoring to engage with OpenAI? What's the payoff for developers to build things on this nascent\\/emerging platform?\\nThe modern developer's toolkit is astonishingly rich. GenAI offers a direct payoff for most developers, assisting them with everything from bug fixes to feature development. This speed and utility mean that they, and their executives, want to leverage this technology now.\\nRelated stories\\nOpenAI is competing to be a developer's default choice. They've provided top-quality models and continue to expand what's available in the API, but the real game-changer is the new app directory and SDK. This is a clear signal that OpenAI is attempting to create a platform where developers can find users and earn revenue, much like Apple did with the App Store.\\nQ: What are the drawbacks for developers building on OpenAI's platform? What did you see on Monday that changes this situation, if anything?\\nWith such fierce competition and an intense pace of innovation, the primary challenge for developers is simply keeping up. They face a strategic dilemma: do they go all-in on one platform, or do they spread their bets across multiple tools? This is compounded by the fact that new AI benchmarks are surpassed almost weekly by different competitors, and internal security and IT teams can only ingest so many new tools at once.\\nIn the meantime, as the race is on, developers are utilizing these tools both at work and in their free time. This is why hackathons are so critical\\u2014they provide a dedicated space for companies to test tools and for developers to gain hands-on experience, all while providing valuable feedback. This is our specialty, and it is a key component of a successful developer strategy.\\nFrom what we saw on Monday, OpenAI is making a significant statement that it wants to be the next platform. Their investments in infrastructure, the new app directory, and a new coding agent all signal that they are here to stay and want to be the default choice for developers.\\nQ: How far away is OpenAI from challenging the current major platforms, Apple iOS, Google Android etc? What's missing or different here?\\nThe comparison to Apple and Google is a red herring. What OpenAI is doing is not a traditional platform play \\u2014 it's a straight-up attempt to build the dominant conversational operating system of the future. The platform is moving from the device to the conversation itself. This is a massive new challenge: creating a community of developers that will build on top of this conversational platform, regardless of the device. That's a new frontier, and I feel incredibly fortunate to be a part of it and see how it unfolds.\\nQ: What else struck you from DevDay?\\nOne of the things Jony Ive said really stuck with me. To paraphrase, \\\"Why would we run this new generation of technology through the last generation's interfaces?\\\"\\nThat's a brilliantly simple and profound thought that makes me incredibly excited to find out what they are working on. I just really wish they had told us!\\nSign up for BI's Tech Memo newsletter here. Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.\"\n",

But the lack of standardization means these bespoke build approaches are often extremely complex, which can extend construction timetables and increase the risk of delays. In addition, such designs often result in unpredictable costs and performance, the company says.\\nBy prefabricating many of the essential building blocks of AI data centers, Flex says it can help to standardize data center design and construction. Its integrated platform consists of new megawatt-scale, high-density, liquid-cooled racks that are designed to support the exponentially rising power demands of AI workloads and enable the transition to 800VDC power architectures.\\nOther key components include Flex\\u2019s newly designed capacitive energy storage system, which helps to reduce electrical disturbances from AI workloads, and a highly scalable modular rack-level coolant distribution unit or CDU that provides up to 1.8 MW of flexible capacity. The designs further incorporate prefabricated power pods and skids, which are pre-engineered modular systems that aim to simplify installation and reduce the need for onsite labor through parallel construction. They also utilize fewer interconnects, and with their offsite assembly, can cut weeks off of data center construction timetables, the company said.\\nFlex says its semi-prefabricated data centers will save companies thousands of hours of onsite labor, reducing deployment times from an average of one year to as little as six months. Moreover, its designs are extremely flexible, allowing data center operators to adapt them as necessary to integrate their preferred computing systems from partners such as Nvidia Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc.\\nData center operators will also benefit from Flex\\u2019s lifecycle intelligence software, which provides built-in monitoring for all components, with predictive analytics and system-level optimization tools. In addition, Flex\\u2019s reference designs are supported by a robust supply chain network and global services, which provides support at every step of the process, from sourcing to deployment and fulfillment.\\nFlex President and Chief Commercial Officer Michael Hartung said an integrated design is essential for future data centers, because operators are going to struggle more than ever with power, heat and scale challenges as AI performance demands increase.\\n\\u201cFlex delivers the industry\\u2019s deepest hardware stack by integrating power, cooling and compute with vertically integrated manufacturing at scale,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIts open architecture provides the flexibility required for faster, more predictable deployments, enabling data center operators to keep up with AI demand.\\u201d\\nImage: SiliconANGLE\\/Dreamina AI\\nA message from John Furrier, co-founder of SiliconANGLE:\\nSupport our mission to keep content open and free by engaging with theCUBE community.

This felony charge, he added, carried a mandatory minimum prison sentence of five years in federal prison but is punishable by up to 20 years in prison. Rinderknecht was expected to make his first appearance in a federal court in Orlando later that day, Essayli said. Rinderknecht has not yet entered a plea.\\nBut more curious than the allegation that a Florida man was responsible for setting a small brush fire on the other side of the country that ultimately ravaged the entire region was the \\u201cdigital evidence\\u201d in the criminal affidavit that Essayli presented to the media. Investigators, he noted, allege that some months prior to the burning of the Pacific Palisades, Rinderknecht had prompted ChatGPT to generate \\u201ca dystopian painting showing, in part, a burning forest and a crowd fleeing from it.\\u201d A screen at the press conference showed several iterations on such a concept, some including buildings engulfed in flames.\\nIt\\u2019s not clear whether this is the first time a user\\u2019s ChatGPT history has been used as evidence against them in a criminal case, nor whether OpenAI, the tech company that developed it, collaborated with law enforcement in their investigation of Rinderknecht. The AI firm\\u2019s policies state that they require \\u201ca subpoena, court order, search warrant or equivalent before disclosing requested non-content user information,\\u201d and only shares content \\u201cin response to a valid warrant or equivalent.\\u201d They also provide \\u201conly the data specified in the legal process,\\u201d the policy states. Sam Altman, OpenAI\\u2019s CEO, has warned that ChatGPT offers no legal confidentiality. And the AI for Change Foundation, a nonprofit that advocates for ethical AI with enhanced safeguards, has pointed out that court precedents are evolving in this area, with judges in the U.S. and abroad ruling that AI chatbot logs are discoverable records.\\nOpenAI did not immediately return a request for comment.\\nEssayli said that in addition to the ChatGPT pictures, the Justice Department\\u2019s allegations against Rinderknecht are supported by evidence found on his phone, alleged false statements to authorities, as well as \\u201chis behavior during the Lachman Fire,\\u201d which he is charged with \\u201cmaliciously starting\\u201d on a hilltop in the Pacific Palisades shortly after midnight on New Year\\u2019s Day. The Lachman Fire was suppressed by firefighters \\u2014 according to the criminal complaint, Rinderknecht called 911 several times to report it and then returned to take video of emergency responders \\u2014 but continued to smolder in underground root systems until extreme Santa Ana winds, hot and dry, caused it to surface and spread on Jan. 7, then explode as the Palisades Fire. The same day, the Eaton Fire ignited in the San Gabriel Mountains of east L.A. County. That blaze ultimately killed 19 people.\\nWhile the official statement from the U.S. Attorney\\u2019s Office on the case does not mention the ChatGPT images discovered in Rinderknecht\\u2019s record of exchanges with the chatbot, Essayli seemed to suggest that they could be used in court as proof of premeditated intent to commit arson. He declined to address the question of possible motive. Rinderknecht had been working as an Uber driver in the area shortly before the Lachman Fire ignited, with two of his passengers from late that evening telling investigators that he appeared angry and agitated during their rides.\\nThe legal matter of admitting ChatGPT evidence remains mostly uncharted. It\\u2019s likely, however, that attorneys and law enforcement will increasingly regard chatbot logs as forensically relevant to prosecutions in the same way text messages and online communications are. They can provide revealing insights into states of mind and individual preoccupations \\u2014 fire, for example. One might imagine their secrets safer with an AI program than another person, but, as with all digital information, the data can always be uncovered.\"\n",

A \\u00a319.5 billion ($25 billion) investment in Argentina for a massive AI data centre? It feels audacious, bordering on visionary and undeniably risky. But that is precisely what OpenAI and Buenos Aires-based Sur Energy are proposing with their new project, one that could reshape Latin America's role in global artificial intelligence more than any other country. The plan hinges on a few deep bets: Argentina's energy and regulatory landscape must deliver on what OpenAI expects, while OpenAI itself is under pressure to fulfil its promises to Argentina.\\nWhat is OpenAI's 'Stargate Argentina'?\\nAt the heart of this massive proposal is the establishment of a data centre in Argentina, dubbed 'Stargate Argentina', which would be OpenAI's first major infrastructure effort in Latin America. According to reports, OpenAI and Sur Energy have signed a letter of intent to launch the project, with the facility anticipated to reach an enormous capacity of up to 500 megawatts of AI computing power.\\nFurthermore, the deal is intended to operate under Argentina's RIGI regime, a framework meant to attract large scale investments through tax incentives for projects exceeding \\u00a3156 million ($200 million). If realised, the infrastructure that they are building would rank among Argentina's largest ever technology and energy projects.\\nThe project is not just about erecting buildings and cooling systems. The plan reportedly demands reliable power generation, fibre networks, and potentially onsite renewable energy sources to support such intensive usage. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has proclaimed this as more than a computer centre as he said, 'It's about putting artificial intelligence in the hands of people across Argentina. We are excited to work with Argentina as it moves toward becoming an AI hub for all of Latin America.'\\nAltman is linking the project to broader goals of democratising access to tools and capabilities. However, it is very important to note that currently the agreement remains nonbinding. Much will depend on regulatory, permitting, and local execution dynamics, so OpenAI is not yet legally bound.\\nWhy Did OpenAI Choose Argentina?\\nAt first glance, Argentina might seem an unlikely pick for a multibillion-pound AI facility. But the country offers several strategic advantages. Its abundant renewable energy potential, particularly in Patagonia and southern provinces, can help provide clean, and most likely affordable power to OpenAI's high-demand compute systems.\\nArgentina's RIGI framework also offers incentives that the company would benefit from. These include tax exemptions, currency exchange flexibility, and streamlined approvals that are specifically designed to attract large-scale foreign investment just like this one. Moreover, in a region hungry for technological dominance, Argentina may see the proposal as a chance to leapfrog into a new chapter of digital leadership before competitors.\\nHigh Stakes and Hurdles\\nHowever, the risks are high for both sides. Argentina has long battled economic volatility, inflation, and complex regulatory shifts. While conditions appear settled for now, ensuring stable and reliable policy over the years necessary to build and operate such a vast project will be a major test.\\nThe nonbinding status of the agreement means either party could pull back before the execution begins. Beyond that, local community impact, environmental assessments, grid stability, and coordination with provincial governments can all be hurdles. The power infrastructure required by a 500 MW facility cannot simply plug into existing grids without upgrades, and any delays in permitting or construction could rapidly raise costs for OpenAI.\\nMoreover, the project comes at a time when OpenAI itself is under pressure to scale responsibly. The company recently completed a secondary share sale that pushed its valuation to \\u00a3390 billion ($500 billion), signalling very high investor confidence but also expectations of delivery that will depend on the execution of massive deals like Stargate Argentina.\\nOriginally published on IBTimes UK\"\n",

Is the future of high-skilled human jobs at risk? - The Economic Times\\nSocial card title: AI to now manage Rs 6,000 crore fund, all analysts fired. Is the future of high-skilled human jobs at risk?\\nSocial card description: A San Francisco-based venture capital firm, Davidovs Venture Collective (DVC), has replaced its entire team of human analysts with artificial intelligence to manage a Rs 6,000 crore fund focused on AI startups. The firms AI tools now handle investment sourcing, due diligence, and portfolio management, while limited partners from major tech firms assist part-time. The move reflects a larger shift in how automation is transforming knowledge-based work.\\nA Radical Shift in Venture Capital\\nAccording to Business Insider, four-year-old Davidovs Venture Collective (DVC) has completely replaced its team of human analysts with AI systems to manage its newly launched $75 million (approximately Rs 6,000 crore) fund. Founded by husband-and-wife duo Marina Davidova and Nick Davidov, the firm is now operating an entirely AI-powered fund focused on Series A and B startups, particularly in the artificial intelligence sector itself.Previously employing five human analysts, DVC decided more than a year ago to dissolve those positions and instead use AI tools for deal sourcing, evaluation, due diligence, portfolio monitoring, and memo preparation. This marks one of the first instances of a venture capital fund running its operations without any human analysts on staff.\\nHuman Intuition Meets Machine Precision\\nDespite automation, Davidova maintains that human judgment still plays a vital role. Emotional intelligence and founder evaluation, she noted, cannot yet be replicated by algorithms. DVC now relies on 170 limited partners (LPs) \\u2014 including professionals and founders from OpenAI, Google, Meta, Microsoft, Tesla, SpaceX, and Perplexity \\u2014 who work part-time and use AI-driven tools to help manage investments.These LPs, often highly experienced in technology, receive a share of profits instead of traditional salaries. According to Davidov, 30\\u201340% of the carried interest from each deal goes to these contributors, making DVC\\u2019s structure both community-driven and performance-based. The firm has already invested $21 million in 120 startups, including Perplexity and Thinking Machines Lab, positioning itself as a new model for AI-era venture investing.\\nThe Bigger Picture: AI\\u2019s Encroachment on Human Roles\\nDVC\\u2019s move is not an isolated event. A report cited by The Mirror found that AI systems now perform as well or better than humans in nearly 48% of professional tasks, including roles such as clerks, sales managers, and editors. Even creative and analytical professions are beginning to feel the pressure, with tools like Anthropic\\u2019s Claude Opus 4.1 and OpenAI\\u2019s GPT-5 rivaling human workers in complex assignments.OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has voiced both concern and optimism about this shift. Speaking to Rowan Cheung after OpenAI\\u2019s DevDay, Altman reflected that up to 40% of existing jobs could eventually be automated. He likened this transformation to past industrial revolutions, arguing that every era has redefined what \\u201creal work\\u201d means \\u2014 from farming to desk jobs, and now to digital automation.\\nAltman\\u2019s perspective highlights how technological progress continually reshapes human purpose. He pointed out that a farmer from decades ago might have viewed today\\u2019s office jobs as frivolous \\u2014 just as future generations may view current work in an AI-driven economy. Yet, he remains confident that humans will continue to find meaning and creativity beyond routine employment, whether through innovation, exploration, or problem-solving.\\nIndia\\u2019s Path: Risk or Opportunity?\\nIn India, the NITI Aayog report titled Roadmap for Job Creation in the AI Economy takes a more balanced stance. It estimates that AI could create 4 million new jobs by 2030, particularly in technology and customer experience sectors, even as some traditional roles face redundancy. The report emphasizes urgent upskilling and education reforms to make India a global AI talent hub by 2035.As Debjani Ghosh, Distinguished Fellow at NITI Aayog, noted, the line between job loss and job creation depends on the decisions made today. The roadmap calls for a National AI Talent Mission to ensure India adapts rather than lags in this transformation.\\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\"\n",

Then again, it's not exactly aimed at mainstream PC buyers. The systems, which will also be available under various brand names from OEM partners, won't even come with Windows. A Copilot+ PC this is not. Instead, it ships with a custom spin of Ubuntu Linux.\\nSpark is actually intended for AI and robotics developers, data scientists, and machine learning researchers looking for a lower-cost workstation platform that's still capable of running models up to 200 billion parameters in size.\\nThese kinds of workloads are incredibly memory-hungry, which makes running them on consumer graphics processors impractical. High-end workstation cards, like the RTX Pro 6000, can be had with up to 96 GB of speedy GDDR7, but a single card will set you back more than $8,000, and that's before you factor in the rest of the platform cost.\\nAt the time of launch, the DGX Spark is technically Nvidia's highest capacity workstation GPU \\u2014 at least until its Blackwell Ultra-based DGX Station makes its debut.\\nHoney, I shrunk the superchip\\nPowering the DGX Spark is the GB10 system-on-a-chip, which is essentially a miniaturized version of the Grace-Blackwell Superchips that power its flagship NVL72 rack systems.\\nAs we explored back at Hot Chips, the GB10 is composed of two compute dies connected at 600 GB\\/s via Nvidia's proprietary NVLink chip-to-chip interconnect tech. And, in case you're wondering, this same technology will eventually be used to mesh Nvidia's GPUs to Intel's future client CPUs as part of a tie-up between the two chip heavyweights.\\nThe GPU tile is capable of delivering up to a petaFLOP of sparse FP4 or around 31 teraFLOPS at single precision (FP32) \\u2014 putting it on par with an RTX 5070 in terms of raw performance. Yes, the $550 consumer card does offer more than twice the memory bandwidth, but with just 12 GB of GDDR7, you'll be fairly limited in terms of what models and AI workloads you can run.\\nUnlike Nvidia's original Grace CPU, the GB10's CPU tile isn't using Arm's Neoverse V2 cores. Instead, the chip was designed in collaboration with MediaTek and features 20 ARMv9.2 cores. Ten of those are Arm's high-performance X925 cores, while the remaining are based on its efficiency-optimized Cortex A725 cores.\\nMuch like Apple's M-series and AMD's Strix Halo SoCs, both the GB10's CPU and GPU are fed by a common pool of LPDDR5x. This tight coupling of compute and memory has allowed these chipmakers to achieve bandwidths more than twice that of conventional PC platforms today. In the case of the GB10, Nvidia is claiming 273 GB\\/s of memory bandwidth.\\n- Microsoft hypes PCs with NPUs, still can't offer a good reason to buy one\\n- Panther Lake sets stage for Intel's 2 nm comeback, but many details still TBD\\n- Qualcomm solders Arduino to its edge AI ambitions, debuts Raspberry Pi rival\\n- Nvidia wants to put a GB300 Superchip on your desk with DGX Station, Spark PCs\\nScaling out\\nOne thing you'll find on the Spark that you won't find on other systems is high-speed networking. Just like Nvidia's datacenter platforms, the Spark's GB10 is accompanied by an integrated ConnectX-7 networking card with a pair of QSFP Ethernet ports out the back.\\nWhile you could theoretically use these for high-speed networking, the ports are actually designed to connect two DGX Sparks together, effectively doubling its fine-tuning and inferencing capabilities.\\nIn this config, Nvidia says users will be able to run inference on models up to 405 billion parameters at 4-bit precision.\\nDGX Spark systems from Nvidia, Acer, Asus, Dell Tech, Gigabyte, HPE, Lenovo, and MSI will be available for purchase starting Oct. 15. \\u00ae\"\n",

Powered by the Grace Blackwell GB10 Superchip, it delivers up to one petaFLOP of AI performance and 128GB unified memory for $3,999. Designed for developers and researchers, this \\\"personal supercomputer\\\" brings large-model training out of the cloud and onto the desk.\\nWhat\\u2019s happened?

With the GB10 Grace Blackwell Superchip inside, it delivers up to 1 petaFLOP of compute, 128 GB unified memory, and the ability to run models with up to 200 billion parameters \\u2014 all for $3,999. It\\u2019s not your typical desktop PC, though. Instead, it\\u2019s a data-center engine in a compact shell. It\\u2019s already drawing attention for how it blurs the line between workstation and data-center system.\\n- Powered by the GB10 Grace Blackwell Superchip, packing GPU + CPU with unified memory and NVLink-C2C interconnect.\\n- Delivers up to 1 petaFLOP of AI compute (FP4 precision) and can support models up to 200 billion parameters.\\n- Comes with 128 GB unified memory and up to 4 TB NVMe SSD for high-speed data storage.\\n- Pricing landed at $3,999, up from earlier expectations of $3,000.\\n- Compact form factor with ports including USB4, 10 GbE LAN, and support for ConnectX-7 networking for clustering two DGX Sparks into a 405 billion-parameter system.\\n- Designed with AI developers in mind, it supports major frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow, along with NVIDIA\\u2019s full AI stack.\\nWhy this is important: This marks one of the clearest steps yet in bringing real AI compute to desktops, stripping reliance on remote clusters. By shrinking enterprise-grade power into something that fits under a monitor, Nvidia is breaking down the wall between research labs and living rooms. It\\u2019s a move that could redefine how and where AI innovation happens. The DGX Spark also serves as a statement of intent from Nvidia: AI is no longer just a cloud service, it\\u2019s a local tool for creators, researchers, and developers.\\n- Shifts AI development workflows from cloud-only to hybrid\\/local setups.\\n- It lets smaller teams, researchers, and startups prototype and fine-tune large models in-house.\\n- Makes serious AI horsepower more affordable, considering $3,999 is pocket change next to data-center costs.\\n- Serves as a signal that heavy AI computing doesn\\u2019t have to stay locked in server farms.\\n- Forces rivals to rethink how much AI muscle can be squeezed into compact, power-efficient machines.\\nWhy should I care? For most people, this won\\u2019t mean much as the DGX Spark isn\\u2019t here to replace a Mac Mini or become your next home PC. But that\\u2019s exactly the point. This isn\\u2019t a consumer desktop; it\\u2019s a miniature supercomputer built for developers, researchers, and startups working on large-scale AI models. If you\\u2019re deep in machine learning, running training jobs, or experimenting with generative AI, the DGX Spark could be a game-changer. It brings serio\\u1e6ds data-center muscle to your desk, letting you run massive workloads locally without renting cloud GPUs. Think of it as a personal AI lab: compact, powerful, and unapologetically overkill for anyone not doing high-end AI work.\\n- Researchers and AI hobbyists could train or fine-tune larger models locally, reducing latency and cloud costs.\\n- Sensitive or proprietary datasets can stay on-premises, avoiding cloud exposure.\\n- With the ability to cluster two units, you can push into even bigger model territory (405B parameter class).\\n- It acts as a bridge: build on Spark locally, then deploy to Nvidia\\u2019s DGX Cloud or larger AI infrastructure.\\nOkay, so what\\u2019s next? Well, Nvidia isn\\u2019t stopping with the DGX Spark. The company has already confirmed that major PC makers, including Acer, Dell, HP, Lenovo, and MSI, are lining up their own versions. As such, you can expect to see Spark-inspired systems popping up everywhere once production ramps up. On Nvidia\\u2019s end, the focus now shifts to building out its DGX software ecosystem, so developers can easily scale their workloads from desktop to cloud without skipping a beat. It\\u2019s part of a bigger trend we\\u2019re seeing with AI compute going personal. What used to take server racks and enterprise budgets is slowly being squeezed into smaller, quieter boxes.\"\n",

As part of an appeals process in an attempt to get back his security clearance, the man told investigators he felt his bosses spied on him too much and that the interrogation over the porn snafu was akin to the \\u201cSpanish Inquisition.\\\"\\nOn March 23, 2023, a DOE employee attempted to back up his personal porn collection. His goal was to use the 187,000 images collected over the past 30 years as training data for an AI-image generator. He said he had depression, something he\\u2019d struggled with since he was a kid. \\u201cDuring the depressive episode he felt \\u2018extremely isolated and lonely,\\u2019 and started \\u2018playing\\u2019 with tools that made generative images as a coping strategy, including \\u2018robot pornography,\\u2019\\u201d according to a DOE report on the incident.\\nFueled by depression, the man meant to back up his collection and create a base for training AI to make better \\u201crobot pornography\\u201d but he uploaded it to the government computer by accident. He didn\\u2019t realize what he\\u2019d done until DOE investigators came calling six months later to ask why their servers were now filled with thousands of pornographic pictures.\\n\\u201cThe Individual \\u2018thought that even though his personal drives were connected to [his employer\\u2019s], they were somehow partitioned, and his personal material would not contaminate his [government-issued computer],\\u201d a DOE report said.\\nAccording to the report, the man was using his cellphone to look at AI-generated porn images, but the screen wasn\\u2019t big enough so he moved the pictures to his government computer. \\u201cHe also reported that, since the 1990s, he had maintained a \\u2018giant compressed file with several directories of pornographic images,\\u2019 which he moved to his personal cloud storage drive so he could use them to make generative images,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIt was this directory of sexually explicit images that was ultimately uploaded to his employer\\u2019s network when he performed a back-up procedure on March 23, 2023.\\u201d\\nThe 187,000 images represented a lifetime\\u2019s collection. \\u201cHe stated that the sexually explicit images were an accumulation of \\u201825\\u201330 years worth of pornographic material\\u2019 he had collected on his personal computer,\\u201d he said. He told a DOE psychologist that he should have realized he\\u2019d backed up his personal porn collection to a DOE network but said he \\u201cwas not thinking multiple steps ahead or considering the consequences at the time because he was so depressed.\\u201d\\nAccording to the DOE employee, he\\u2019s been treated for depression since he was a kid. He has ups and downs, and was in a bad headspace when he accidentally uploaded his entire porn collection. He admitted he violated HR rules, but \\u201cdid not think it was very wrong,\\u201d according to the DOE ruling. He also \\u201casserted that his employer \\u2018was spying on him a little too much\\u2019...and compared the interview with his employer following the discovery of his conduct to \\u2018the Spanish Inquisition.\\u2019\\u201d\\nWhen someone loses their security clearance with the DOE, they can appeal to get it back. In this case, the appeal led to a lengthy investigation and multiple interviews with various DOE psychologists and the man\\u2019s wife. When the DOE makes a ruling on an appeal they publish it publicly online, which is why we know about the man\\u2019s private porn stash.\\nHe did not get his clearance back. \\u201cThe DOE Psychologist opined that the individual's probability of experiencing another depressive episode in the future was \\u2018very high,\\u2019\\u201d according to the report.\"\n",

And right now, you can get the unit for just US$799 \\u2013 nearly half its expected retail price.\\nThe Robotin R2 is billed as the world\\u2019s first fully autonomous carpet-cleaning robot, combining deep vacuuming, automated washing and intelligent drying in one compact, low-maintenance modular system. And right now, you can get the unit for just US$799 \\u2013 nearly half its expected retail price.\\nDesigned to tackle one of the last frontiers of home robotics \\u2013 efficient carpet care \\u2013 the R2 uses advanced AI navigation to cover every corner of the home, promising to deliver a professional-grade clean with minimal human input. Operating much like the latest robot vacuums, the R2 is controlled via an app that maps floor cover, switching between washing, drying and vacuuming across level surfaces. The AI-Perception System uses 12 sensors to detect flooring types, map surfaces and plan out the most efficient cleaning routes. Much like other robot cleaners, it also identifies obstacles in real time. Users can also add \\\"no-go\\\" zones to amend the system's automated mapping.\\nWhile we haven't got our hands on this model yet, early testers have been impressed with the all-in-one system, and the Kickstarter campaign has rapidly surpassed its fundraising goal so backers can feel pretty safe that the units will be shipped out on time (albeit, that's not until March 2026).\\nThe creators claim that the R2's three-stage auto-washing system can handle the toughest stains and debris, cleaning up to 400 sq ft (around 37 sq m) of carpet per hour while recycling dirty water to reduce waste. Its RapidHeat Technology heats water to 140 \\u00b0F (60 \\u00b0C) within 10 minutes to speed up stain removal and reduce drying time. Once the washing is done, the drying system circulates warm air \\u2013 110 \\u00b0F (43 \\u00b0C) \\u2013 through carpet fibers, drying up to 400 sq ft of carpet in around two hours. And it's equipped with humidity sensors that adjust airflow in real time to ensure an even dry.\\nAs for the vacuum system, the creators say the R2 uses an industrial-grade motor with a special airflow design to lift dirt and pet hair embedded in carpet fibers, delivering 115 AW of vacuum power and 48 cubic feet per minute (CFM) of suction. Anti-tangle brushes prevent hair buildup \\u2013 something that can be frustrating with robot vacuums without these \\u2013 and a dirt-detection system monitors and targets areas needing the most attention, focusing on those spots until it gauges them to be suitably cleaned.\\nThe R2's docking station automates refilling and waste emptying, with a 2.4-gallon clean water tank and 1.6-gallon dirty-water compartment.\\nA 1.8-liter dust bin can hold up to 60 days\\u2019 worth of dirt, depending on cleaning required. The creators claim that its 10,000-mAh battery recharges from flat to 80% in 24 minutes, with the robot returning to the dock to empty and charge on longer jobs.\\nThe unit itself is quite compact, measuring roughly 16 x 15.7 x 6 inches (40.6 x 39.9 x 15.2 cm). Its creators claim this robot cleaner is designed to bring industrial-grade performance into the home in an eco-friendly and \\\"hands-off\\\" way.\\n\\\"We envision Robotin R2 evolving into a multi-functional household assistant,\\\" said its creators. \\\"Our ultimate goal is to reduce the burden of everyday chores \\u2013 making 'Robot In, Chores Out' a reality.\\\"\\nIf this sounds like something you could do with around the house, the Robotin R2 starts at $799 ($700 discount) \\u2013 which includes the mobile unit and dock, as well as two cleaning solutions \\u2013 now until the campaign winds up in around 40 days. It won't be shipped to every country, so check the Kickstarter page for more details and extended specifications.\\nSource: Kickstarter\\nNote: New Atlas may earn commission from purchases made via links.\"\n",

Harvey's toughest competitor isn't another niche startup; it's OpenAI.\\n\\\"Our largest competitor is by far, indirectly, OpenAI,\\\" Weinberg said. \\\"I mean that in the sense of just \\u2014 you need to make sure that your product gives so much more value than whatever the general products they're releasing are.\\\"\\nHarvey's biggest rival is also a backer. The OpenAI Startup Fund wrote one of the first checks into Harvey and has continued to increase its stake with additional funding. To date, Harvey has raised over $800 million.\\nThe startup, last valued at $5 billion, has counted on being domain-specific to attract large law firms. Harvey just signed its 50th client in the Am Law 100, a group of the largest US law firms by revenue, the company said.\\nThe founders say they tell their team that customers will measure Harvey against whatever general-purpose tool OpenAI ships next, even if it doesn't specifically target legal work.\\nSurveys by the American Bar Association and the Thomson Reuters Institute indicate that lawyers are already using ChatGPT to draft memos, conduct legal research, and predict case outcomes \\u2014 with mixed results. Judges are increasingly catching fake citations in court documents.\\nAcross the software market, concerns are growing that the foundation model companies will launch specialized tools for narrow domains or use cases. Recently, OpenAI blogged about a set of internal tools \\u2014 a contract review tool among them \\u2014 that it uses to run its own business.\\nOpenAI may be famous for its chatbot, but since 2022, it has emerged as a default partner for startups to build frontier tech for their industries without training their own large language models. Harvey builds on its models and works closely with the company to deploy custom-trained models and features for legal professionals.\\nRelated stories\\nOpenAI hasn't publicly released the tools it showed off. Still, the blog posts fanned fears that it could one day compete with the startups it now enables.\\nHarvey's founders say the threat persists whether OpenAI targets lawyers or not.\\nPereyra argued that big cloud and model providers will continue to perfect general-purpose AI platforms \\u2014 helpful developments, but not a focus for Harvey. \\\"They're solving a very different problem,\\\" he said.\\nHarvey wants to build the operating system for law firms: software that knows what a matter is, routes tasks to the right people, pulls the right documents at the right moment, and can swap in different models under strict controls.\\nIn that view, the founders say the value isn't in packaging ever-better models; it's in the application layer that makes those models useful inside a law firm.\\n\\\"If you think about them as the main competitor,\\\" Weinberg said, \\\"all that does is make you create better tools for your vertical faster.\\\"\\nHave a tip?

OpenAI's 4o Image Generation model and the Sora 2 video model are such examples. ChatGPT went viral earlier this year for its image generation abilities, helping OpenAI sign millions of new ChatGPT users. The recently launched Sora app became the most downloaded iPhone app in less than a week. Google's Nano Banana image generator is another good example, having helped Gemini become the most popular iPhone app in the weeks preceding the Sora release. Seeing Microsoft AI announce a new AI image generation model developed in-house (MAI-Image-1), and tease its exciting performance and speed, is no surprise.\\nMAI-Image-1 might not have a name as cool as Google's Nano Banana, but Microsoft AI is positioning it as a state-of-the-art model that can compete against the best alternatives out there. Microsoft's AI lab noted in a blog post that MAI-Image-1 currently ranks in the top 10 text-to-image models on LMArena, which is impressive. LMArena is a testing ground for unreleased AI products where users can compare different models before their public release.\\nWhen will MAI-Image-1 be available in Microsoft products?\\nMicrosoft says it developed MAI-Image-1 with the goal of \\\"delivering genuine value for creators.\\\" The company put \\\"a lot of care into avoiding repetitive or generically stylized outputs,\\\" prioritizing \\\"rigorous data selection and nuanced evaluation focused on tasks that closely mirror real-world creative use cases\\\" and taking into account feedback from creators. That's a lot of marketing speak in Microsoft's announcement that does little to explain what MAI-Image-1 is good for. The company says that MAI-Image-1 \\\"excels at generating photorealistic imagery,\\\" including lighting effects, landscapes, and \\\"much more.\\\" Microsoft also teases that MAI-Image-1 is faster than some of its direct competitors, without offering any benchmarks to back those claims.\\nStill, MAI-Image-1 coming in the ninth place in LMArena's top 10 for text-to-image models, as of this writing, indicates that Microsoft's in-house AI image generator is appreciated by testers. LMArena's top 10 includes several models from Google, ByteDance, and Tencent. Nano Banana is ranked second. The images above were probably generated with MAI-Image-1, as they were included in the official announcement. They don't feature any watermarks that would indicate their origin.\\nMicrosoft says it will take into account feedback from early users before releasing MAI-Image-1 in Copilot and Bing Image Creator. It's likely that MAI-Image-1 will be available in other Microsoft products that feature built-in AI capabilities, as Microsoft AI teases MAI-Image-1 to be the \\\"step on our journey and paves the way for more immersive, creative, and dynamic experiences inside our products.\\\"\"\n",

Employees bring their own tools into the office, whether it's a preferred device, messaging platform or an AI chatbot (like Shadow AI). These rogue users circumvent IT policies by deploying their own tech, potentially opening organizations to attacks or data leaks.\\nAccording to Microsoft 71 percent of UK employees have used unapproved consumer tools at work, and 51 percent continue to do so. Forty-nine percent use them to draft and respond to workplace communication, 40 percent for reports and presentations, and 22 percent carry out finance-related tasks with bots.\\nThe figures tally with earlier reports concerning employees pasting information into ChatGPT, potentially putting sensitive information at risk. That report in July claimed ChatGPT was very much the tool of choice for employees. While Microsoft's research unsurprisingly extols the virtues of AI tools and the potential for productivity, Copilot wasn't namechecked.\\nMicrosoft is encouraging customers to BYOC \\u2013 Bring Your Own Copilot \\u2013 into the office to sidestep companies that don't provide AI tools to employees. Got a personal Microsoft 365 subscription with Copilot? Then bring it in. In this situation, IT are expected manage the AI assistant - because they don't have enough to do already.\\nAccording to Microsoft, 32 percent of respondents are concerned about the privacy of company or customer data, yet just 29 percent are worried about IT security. Forty-one percent said they use Shadow AI tools because \\\"it's what they're used to in their personal life.\\\"\\n- Microsoft declares bring your Copilot to work day, usurping IT authority\\n- OpenAI bans suspected Chinese accounts using ChatGPT to plan surveillance\\n- JetBrains backs open AI coding standard that could gnaw at VS Code dominance\\n- Google DeepMind minds the patch with AI flaw-fixing scheme\\nSadly for Microsoft, that likely means ChatGPT. Copilot has yet to set the world alight despite Microsoft relentlessly pushing the technology onto its customers. Now it seems the long criticized practice of shadow IT is ok if it helps convince more users to climb aboard the AI hype train.\\nMicrosoft has highlighted the risks of unmanaged AI tools in a report that ends on a bullish note for the technology. More than half of the employees in the survey are feeling optimistic about the service.\\nDarren Hardman, CEO, Microsoft UK & Ireland, said: \\\"Businesses must ensure the AI tools in use are built for the workplace, not just the living room.\\n\\\"The message is clear: only enterprise-grade AI delivers the functionality that employees want, wrapped in the privacy and security every organisation demands.\\\" \\u00ae\"\n",

While speaking at the Zeta Live conference, Sculley remarked that Apple has been unable to thrive in the field of artificial intelligence and that OpenAI is currently leading the way.\\nAt the conference, Sculley discussed the collaboration between former Apple designer Jony Ive and OpenAI to create the next generation of devices powered by AI.\\n\\u201cHe\\u2019s the one who actually designed and built the iMac, the iPod, the iPhone, and the iPad\\u2026If there\\u2019s anyone who is probably going to be able to bring that dimension to the LLM, in this case OpenAI, it\\u2019s probably going to be Jony Ive, working with Sam Altman,\\u201d Sculley said.\\nSculley noted that Apple has fallen behind other technology companies like OpenAI, Google, Meta, and Amazon regarding regular product updates and innovation centred around AI. Citing examples such as the delayed AI overhaul of the Siri voice assistant, Sculley said these are all indicators that the company has not kept pace with the changes brought about by AI.\\n\\u201cAI has not been a particular strength for them,\\u201d Sculley remarked during the conference.\\nNotably, Apple has been using OpenAI\\u2019s ChatGPT to address many of the more intricate questions posed by users to Siri. Reports have also surfaced about Apple looking towards Google in the future to enhance its updated Siri features.\\nSculley also recommended that whoever takes over from Tim Cook as Apple\\u2019s next CEO should be capable of guiding Apple into an AI-centric future. In his opinion, the forthcoming leader must navigate Apple through a transition where AI agents, rather than traditional apps, shape the user experience.\\nThe Cupertino-based tech major had been a pioneer of apps in the past, famously popularising the slogan \\u201cThere\\u2019s an app for that\\u201d in its iPhone commercials.\\nHowever, Sculley thinks that Apple needs to think beyond apps and about AI. He argued that software centred around apps sells tools, whereas a shift to AI agents would push the industry towards subscription-based models \\u2014 earning revenue as long as users rely on AI.\\nSculley contended that Apple must evolve from the \\u201capps era\\u201d to what he terms the \\u201cagentic era,\\u201d where intelligent AI agents function on users\\u2019 behalf without the need for numerous separate applications.\\n\\u201cIn the agentic era, we don\\u2019t need a lot of apps; it can all be done with smart agents,\\u201d he added.\\nof NDTV Profit\"\n",

Its features are extremely basic, and sometimes it even gets it wrong. At this point, Apple is lagging terribly behind the rest. However, given Apple\\u2019s vast resources, it looks like the company could be buying its way back to the top. According to a recent CNBC report, Apple is nearing a deal to acquire an AI company, potentially beating out Elon Musk.\\nApple beats out Elon Musk in AI deal\\nThe report reveals that Apple is in late stage talks to acquire talent from a computer vision startup called Prompt AI, as well as buying the company\\u2019s technology. What\\u2019s interesting about this acquisition is that in addition to Apple, Prompt AI is facing suitors from other companies, such as xAI by Elon Musk and Neuralink.\\nHowever, the report suggests that the company is close to inking a deal with Apple. If that is the case, it should give Apple a much-needed boost in the AI space. Apple is known to acquire companies just for their technology. This makes sense as Apple wants to use the tech for itself and integrate it into its own products.\\nThe report also reveals that in an audio clip heard by the publication, it said that those who don\\u2019t end up joining Apple will receive a reduced pay. They are also encouraged to apply for open positions at Apple.\\nWhat is Prompt AI, and why does Apple want them?\\nFor those unfamiliar with Prompt AI, the company\\u2019s flagship product is Seemour. This is an home AI platform that enhances home security cameras with advanced visual intelligence capabilities. This means that it allows cameras to analyze what it sees in real time. It can also help cameras understand and describe what it sees.\\nNow, we know that Apple doesn\\u2019t make home security devices. This begs the question of, why would Apple want Prompt AI and its Seemour platform? For starters, it could help Apple boost its HomeKit ecosystem by giving connected smart home cameras better AI capabilities.\\nHowever, this seems like a rather niche goal. In reality, it feels more like Seemour\\u2019s capabilities could be applied to iPhone cameras, making them smarter at \\u201cseeing\\u201d things, understanding them, and describing them. We also wouldn\\u2019t be surprised if Apple were to apply this tech to its Vision Pro or its rumored smart glasses.\\nLastly, we\\u2019ve already seen how Apple has lost some of its AI talent to competitors. Apple\\u2019s former head of AI models left the company earlier this year ago to join Meta. So, acquiring Prompt AI\\u2019s talent could help the company replenish its ranks.\"\n",

But as creative jobs tremble and AI slop floods the internet, I can\\u2019t help but wonder: do we really want AI generated games?\\nWhat\\u2019s happened? Elon Musk\\u2019s xAI has intensified its push into gaming AI by recruiting ex-Nvidia specialists to build \\u2018world models\\u2019. These world models are AI systems that can simulate real-world physics and environments.\\n- It will create game worlds that are AI-generated, physics-aware, and possibly reactive to player actions.\\n- Two Nvidia veterans, Zeeshan Patel and Ethan He, have been hired by xAI for world modeling.\\n- Musk has already announced that xAI will deliver a \\u2018great AI-generated game\\u2019 by the end of 2026.\\nThis is important because: It\\u2019s not another \\u201cElon does something bold\\u201d story. What\\u2019s happening here strikes at the heart of how games are made and what it means when AI tries to replace parts of that.\\n- If world models can generate terrain, physics, and NPCs automatically, the role of designers and storytellers might shrink.\\n- Game devs could feel pressure too, especially in studios chasing cost savings by outsourcing to AI.\\n- AI slop: AI can generate a lot of game content, but will it be engaging, coherent, and meaningful? As a gamer, I am concerned that it could be shallow, repetitive, or glitchy.\\n- If parts of a game are generated, who gets credit? The control shifts toward those who own the models, infrastructure, and data, and not the human creators.\\n- With more AI-generated games, will there still be space for indie developers?\\nWhy should I care? You may not be a game developer, but if you play games or simply follow tech, this matters more than you think. Letting AI build games might sound futuristic, but video games thrive on human direction, storytelling, and emotional design. Current generative tools still struggle with consistency and that spark of intentional creativity, so I\\u2019ll keep my skepticism handy until we see something that feels less like a demo and more like a genuine gaming experience.\"\n",

Gavin Newsom vetoed SB 771, a California bill that would have fined social platforms up to $1 million (doubled for minors) if they intentionally promoted content that violated state civil rights laws; the measure was authored by Sen. Henry Stern and aimed at companies' algorithmic design as a response to perceived loosening of moderation amid political pressure (Newsom called the bill \\\"premature\\\" and cited concerns about \\\"discriminatory threats, violence and coercive harassment online\\\").\\n- Major tech trade groups and platforms opposed the bill: NetChoice (whose members include Google, Meta and Snap) threatened to sue, and X and Parler argued the law risked unconstitutional suppression of speech; courts have previously blocked related California laws on First Amendment grounds (kid-friendly design, deepfakes, anti-hate moderation rules), so the veto avoids an immediate, likely legal confrontation and regulatory uncertainty for platforms.\\n- Newsom directed a pause to assess whether existing civil-rights laws can address algorithmic harms, signaling a shift toward studying algorithmic accountability before new mandates; if the review finds gaps, expect renewed legislative or enforcement efforts focused on algorithmic promotion of harmful or discriminatory content, keeping platforms under regulatory and legal scrutiny.\"\n",

      "A new AI tool reveals that Campi Flegrei experienced more than 54,000 earthquakes between 2022 and 2025. By mapping these events, researchers discovered a huge, crisp, ring-shaped fault.\n",
      "\n",
      "- AI model trained to pick seismic phases identified about 54,000 earthquakes at Campi Flegrei from 2022 to mid‑2025 versus ~12,000 found by traditional methods, revealing previously unseen faults including a crisp ring fault that encircles the uplifted area (ground uplift ≈10 cm/year); results published in Science.\n",
      "- Fault mapping shows two faults converging beneath Pozzuoli and a surrounding ring fault offshore; researchers warn \"an earthquake in the magnitude 5 range is not out of the question\" (William Ellsworth), note ~360,000 residents live inside the caldera and ~1.5 million in the wider area, and state the shallow seismicity \"does not indicate any migration of magma towards the surface\" (Greg Beroza).\n",
      "- Method and outlook: \"In our approach, we train a machine learning model to pick phases,\" Beroza said, and \"Our Italian colleagues were surprised to see the ring so clearly,\" (Xing Tan); implication—richer seismic catalogs can improve hazard assessment, emergency planning and monitoring, and the technique could be applied to other restless volcanoes such as Santorini.\n",

      "\n",
      "- Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed SB 771, a California bill that would have fined social platforms up to $1 million (doubled for minors) if they intentionally promoted content that violated state civil rights laws; the measure was authored by Sen. Henry Stern and aimed at companies' algorithmic design as a response to perceived loosening of moderation amid political pressure (Newsom called the bill \"premature\" and cited concerns about \"discriminatory threats, violence and coercive harassment online\").\n",
      "- Major tech trade groups and platforms opposed the bill: NetChoice (whose members include Google, Meta and Snap) threatened to sue, and X and Parler argued the law risked unconstitutional suppression of speech; courts have previously blocked related California laws on First Amendment grounds (kid-friendly design, deepfakes, anti-hate moderation rules), so the veto avoids an immediate, likely legal confrontation and regulatory uncertainty for platforms.\n",
      "- Newsom directed a pause to assess whether existing civil-rights laws can address algorithmic harms, signaling a shift toward studying algorithmic accountability before new mandates; if the review finds gaps, expect renewed legislative or enforcement efforts focused on algorithmic promotion of harmful or discriminatory content, keeping platforms under regulatory and legal scrutiny.\n",

      "- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (NYSE: TSM) shares rebounded in premarket trading Monday, recovering from Friday losses as renewed investor enthusiasm for artificial intelligence outweighed mounting geopolitical concerns between Washington and Beijing.\n",
      "- Market impact: optimism about AI-driven demand for advanced chips is boosting TSMC’s stock and could lift the broader semiconductor sector, reflecting expectations of stronger orders from data centers, cloud providers and AI hardware makers.\n",
      "- Outlook and risks: the rally may continue if AI demand materializes, but U.S.-China tensions and Taiwan-related geopolitical risks remain key downside catalysts that could quickly reintroduce volatility and disrupt supply chains.\n",

      "\n",
      "- Serve Robotics, valued at about $900 million, develops autonomous food‑delivery robots and drew investments from Nvidia and Uber between 2020–2022; Uber still holds roughly a 12% stake and has placed Serve’s largest order, while Nvidia largely exited its investment about a year ago.\n",
      "- Uber’s ongoing ownership and big order act as commercial validation that could drive faster deployment and lower last‑mile delivery costs for restaurants and platforms; Nvidia’s cash‑out signals mixed investor confidence and underscores the need for Serve to demonstrate scalable unit economics and secure further capital or partners.\n",
      "- Successful pilot scaling would enable wider city rollouts, additional partnerships or acquisition interest from mobility/logistics firms, and clear use cases in food and small‑parcel delivery, but expansion hinges on regulatory approvals, sidewalk/urban infrastructure, operational reliability and demonstrable ROI.\n",

      "- Jonathan Rinderknecht, 29, was arrested near Melbourne, Florida and federally charged with \"destruction of property by means of fire\" over the January Palisades Fire that killed 12 people and destroyed thousands of structures; the felony carries a mandatory minimum of five years and up to 20 years in prison, and prosecutors cite phone evidence, alleged false statements, his behavior around the Lachman Fire (started Jan. 1) and 911/video activity as part of their case.  \n",
      "- The DOJ affidavit includes ChatGPT-generated images — described as a \"dystopian painting\" of burning forests and cities — created months before the blaze; it is unclear whether OpenAI cooperated, though OpenAI policy requires a subpoena or warrant to disclose content and, as CEO Sam Altman has warned, \"ChatGPT offers no legal confidentiality,\" while courts and advocates note chatbot logs are increasingly treated as discoverable.  \n",
      "- Legal and operational implications: attorneys and law enforcement are likely to treat chatbot logs like other digital communications (texts/emails) as forensic evidence to show premeditation, forcing AI companies to strengthen compliance and disclosure processes and shaping future precedents on user privacy, platform data access and how AI-generated content is used in criminal prosecutions.\n",

      "- Outlook and market impact: executives say further rallies are likely in emerging markets and mutual funds are positioned in advance to capture them; practical implications include investor access to SIPs, domestic and global thematic allocations, and hybrid solutions, while regulatory limits on crypto and overseas exposure will continue to shape product availability and opportunity-cost debates.\n",

      "- Microsoft warns of 'Shadow AI' as employees bring consumer AI tools into work; its UK survey finds 71% have used unapproved consumer tools at work and 51% continue to do so, with 49% using them to draft/respond to workplace communications, 40% for reports and presentations and 22% for finance tasks; Microsoft is promoting BYOC — Bring Your Own Copilot — asking employees to use personal Microsoft 365 Copilot subscriptions while IT is expected to manage those assistants.\n",
      "- Business implications include increased risk of data leaks and unmanaged attack surfaces as shadow tools bypass IT controls; survey shows 32% are concerned about privacy and 29% about IT security while 41% use shadow AI because it mirrors personal-life habits; market impact likely includes pressure on vendors and enterprises to provide sanctioned, enterprise-grade AI, governance tooling and managed offerings, potentially accelerating Copilot adoption and complicating IT authority.\n",
      "- Microsoft frames the fix as enterprise-grade AI plus governance and employee buy-in: more than half of employees surveyed are optimistic about AI, and Darren Hardman, CEO Microsoft UK & Ireland, said: \"Businesses must ensure the AI tools in use are built for the workplace, not just the living room... only enterprise-grade AI delivers the functionality that employees want, wrapped in the privacy and security every organisation demands.\" Expect growth in managed AI offerings, stronger policy controls and continued tension between convenience and security.\n",

      "- NetApp launched the AI Data Engine at NetApp Insight 2025 as a secure, unified extension of ONTAP built on NVIDIA’s AI Data Platform reference design; it runs on a new disaggregated all‑flash AFX appliance (certified for NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD), supports NVIDIA‑accelerated computing (NIM microservices, RTX Pro/Blackwell GPUs), and provides ingestion, data preparation, vector search, automatic change detection, advanced compression, fast semantic discovery and optional DX50 metadata nodes for a global real‑time catalog.\n",
      "- The move positions NetApp as a foundation provider for large-scale “AI factories,” offering packaged hardware plus software to simplify deployment and differentiate from software‑only competitors; NetApp pitches a single unified control plane to connect multicloud data estates and accelerate AI pipelines—“Enterprises can then dramatically accelerate their AI data pipelines by collapsing multiple data preparation and management steps into the integrated NetApp AI Data Engine,” said Chief Product Officer Syam Nair, and analyst Steve McDowell called today’s announcements the first instantiation of NetApp’s AI vision.\n",
      "- NetApp also expanded its cyber defenses by rebranding Ransomware Resilience with AI‑powered data breach detection to spot anomalous user/file behavior and block exfiltration in real time, plus isolated recovery environments and automated forensic guidance to restore impacted workloads; analysts say integrated exfiltration detection in the storage layer is a rare capability and could strengthen NetApp’s competitive moat while reassuring enterprises and accelerating adoption for generative AI and sensitive AI workloads.\n",

      "- Strategic and market impact: this is Google’s largest investment in India and its largest outside the U.S., done in partnership with Bharti Airtel and AdaniConneX to create a global connectivity hub and digital backbone; it strengthens Google Cloud/AI footprint in Asia but comes amid India’s “swadeshi” push and rising local competitors (Zoho, Arattai, MapMyIndia) that pose political and market risks.\n",
      "- Future outlook & use cases: Google projects the hub will serve India, Asia and beyond and attract more subsea cables—\"It is part of a global network of AI centers in 12 different countries,\" said Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian—while Indian IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw called it “a very important contribution to the [India] AI mission,” urged further connectivity (Andaman Islands, Sittwe) and signaled strong government support for scaling regional AI and internet infrastructure.\n",

Key quote: \"Our largest competitor is by far, indirectly, OpenAI,\" — Winston Weinberg.\n",
      "- Product and use cases: Harvey aims to be an operating system for law firms that knows matters, routes tasks, pulls relevant documents, and can swap models under strict controls to support drafting memos, legal research, contract review and case-prediction workflows; surveys show lawyers are already using ChatGPT for these tasks with mixed accuracy and judges have flagged fake citations.\n",
      "- Business implications and outlook: Reliance on foundation-model providers creates a dual dynamic—OpenAI enables Harvey while also posing competitive risk (including internal tools like a contract-review system); Harvey’s strategy is to capture value in the application layer and firm workflows so it outperforms general-purpose products, but founders warn general-model improvements and incumbent specialization could accelerate competition or commoditization.\n",

      "BENGALURU (Reuters) -Google said on Tuesday it would invest $15 billion over five years to set up an artificial intelligence data centre in India's southern state of Andhra Pradesh, its biggest ever investment in the world's most populous nation.  The U.S. tech giant's plan comes amid a tense diplomatic standoff between New Delhi and Washington over tariffs and a stalled trade deal, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi has urged a boycott of foreign goods.  Indian infotech and finance ministers attended the New Delhi event at which Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian said the data centre in Andhra Pradesh would be the company's \"largest AI hub\" outside the United States.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Google will invest $15 billion over five years to build an AI data centre campus in Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh, with an initial 1 GW capacity; Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian called it the company's \"largest AI hub\" outside the United States and said the project aims to \"accelerate India's own AI mission\"; Adani Group and Airtel are partners and the plan includes a new international subsea gateway.\n",
      "- Biggest-ever Google investment in India and part of Alphabet's broader push (about $85 billion this year) to expand data-centre capacity; positions Google to serve nearly a billion Indian internet users and to compete with Microsoft and Amazon, while state officials previously estimated the centre could generate about 188,000 jobs.\n",
      "- Project addresses soaring AI compute demand by linking thousands of chips for cloud AI services and local deployments; Google said the initiative \"creates substantial economic and societal opportunities for both India and the United States\"; rollout could accelerate AI adoption but faces risks from US-India tariff tensions, boycott calls and ongoing Indian antitrust and legal challenges to Google.\n",

      "- Major vendors and hyperscalers have adopted an annual AI-accelerator release cadence through the late 2020s, with detailed roadmaps: AMD’s MI400-series (MI430X/MI450X) slated H2 2026 on TSMC N2 with HBM4/CoWoS‑L and an MI500 follow-up in 2027; Nvidia’s Rubin (R100/R200) due late 2026 with two reticle dies, 288 GB HBM4 (~13 TB/s) and ~50 PFLOPS NVFP4 for inference, Rubin Ultra (VR300) in 2027 with 1 TB HBM4E (~32 TB/s) and ~100 PFLOPS but ~3,600 W power draw; Nvidia CPX for long‑context preprocessing (128 GB GDDR7, ~30 PFLOPS NVFP4); Google’s Ironwood (TPU v7p) delivering 4,614 FP8 TFLOPS and pods up to 42.5 FP8 ExaFLOPS with future TPUs moving to HBM4/N2; Amazon progressing Trainium3→Trainium4 with HBM3E/HBM4; Meta advancing MTIA v3/v4 to N3/N2 chiplets with HBM3E/HBM4; Microsoft’s Maia follow-ups (Braga/Clea) and Intel’s Jaguar Shores GPU planned for 2027.  \n",
      "- Market and operational implications: hyperscalers building custom silicon to cut costs and optimize AI workloads has intensified competition with Nvidia but Nvidia retains leadership for high-performance training/inference and ecosystem momentum (including reported large-scale GPU supply agreements); OpenAI is linked to a reported $10B custom-Broadcom XPU order for 2026 while also maintaining heavy Nvidia GPU commitments; Intel’s Gaudi platform faces uncertain adoption amid a transition to new Intel AI GPUs; supply‑chain and ecosystem limits — e.g., delayed switch hardware for AMD’s UALink and extreme power/cooling requirements for top-end GPUs — will affect large-scale deployments and vendor selection.  \n",
      "- Future outlook and technical trends: continued specialization between low‑precision inference chips (FP4/FP8 optimized) and high‑precision HPC chips (FP32/FP64), widespread migration to TSMC advanced nodes (N3/N2), adoption of HBM4/HBM4E and CoWoS‑L packaging with potential hybrid bonding, and rising emphasis on rack-scale systems and liquid cooling to handle multi‑kilowatt packages; quote encapsulating the dynamic: \"Competition for Nvidia looms.\"\n",

      "- Visa launched the Trusted Agent Protocol to cryptographically verify AI shopping agents via a \"cryptographic trust handshake\": agents are vetted and onboarded through Visa's Intelligent Commerce program, issued unique digital signature keys, and transmit Agent Intent, Consumer Recognition and optional Payment Information; the protocol is built on the HTTP Message Signature standard, aligned with Web Both Auth, developed with Cloudflare, and is available now on Visa's Developer Center and GitHub.\n",
      "- Business implications and market impact: AI-driven traffic to U.S. retail sites has surged ~4,700%, forcing merchants to choose between blocking fraud and allowing legitimate agentic shoppers; Visa cites preventing $40B in fraud (Oct 2022–Sep 2023) and positions the protocol to protect payment flows while effectively acting as a gatekeeper—raising competition and antitrust exposure given Visa's ongoing legal and regulatory pressures and potential to favor large platforms.\n",
      "- Future outlook, use cases and open questions: merchant adoption depends on agentic commerce capturing a meaningful share of completed purchases and on resolving liability for unauthorized agent transactions; Visa aims to build credibility through 2025 and pursue interoperability with Google/AP2, OpenAI/Stripe and standards bodies; key quotes — Rubail Birwadker: \"Merchants need additional tools that provide them with greater insight and transparency into agentic commerce activities to ensure they can participate safely,\" \"This is no-code functionality,\" Jack Forestell: \"We believe the entire payments ecosystem has a responsibility to ensure sellers trust AI agents with the same confidence they place in their most valued customers and networks,\" James Mirfin: \"Every single one of those transactions has been processed by AI.\"\n",

      "- The integrated, semi-prefabricated approach is billed to accelerate deployments by up to 30% and cut onsite labor and construction time from about one year to as little as six months, standardize costs/performance, and remain interoperable with partner compute stacks from Nvidia and AMD while adding lifecycle intelligence software for monitoring, predictive analytics and system-level optimization.\n",
      "- Business impact and outlook: Flex positions the designs to address rising AI power, heat and scale constraints and to enable faster, more predictable rollouts at scale across global supply-chain and services; as Flex President Michael Hartung said, “Flex delivers the industry’s deepest hardware stack by integrating power, cooling and compute with vertically integrated manufacturing at scale.”\n",

      "() -OpenAI has partnered with Broadcom to produce its first in-house artificial intelligence processors, the latest chip tie-up for the ChatGPT maker as it races to secure the computing power needed to meet surging demand for its services. The companies said on Monday that OpenAI would design the chips, which Broadcom will develop and deploy starting in the second half of 2026.\n",
      "\n",
      "- OpenAI will design custom AI processors that Broadcom will develop and begin deploying in the second half of 2026, with a planned rollout totaling 10 gigawatts of capacity and completion by the end of 2029; OpenAI CEO Sam Altman: \"Partnering with Broadcom is a critical step in building the infrastructure needed to unlock AI's potential.\" Power draw of the chips is roughly equivalent to the needs of more than 8 million U.S. households (≈ five times Hoover Dam output). \n",
      "- The deal is part of a broader industry push for custom AI silicon to secure compute and reduce reliance on Nvidia (OpenAI also announced a 6‑GW AMD deal and a separate Nvidia investment/supply agreement for ≥10 GW); Broadcom has emerged as a major beneficiary of the AI chip boom (stock surge since 2022, previously disclosed ~$10B custom AI order speculated to involve OpenAI). Financial terms and funding arrangements were not disclosed. \n",
      "- Operational and market outlook: the multi‑year buildout (2026–2029) aims to scale OpenAI's data‑center capacity to meet surging model demand and power large-scale training/inference, but execution and performance risks remain—past custom-chip efforts at Microsoft and Meta have faced delays or underperformed versus Nvidia, so Nvidia’s short-term dominance is unlikely to be displaced immediately.\n",

      "While CEOs encourage workers to use AI liberally, they may also be injecting friction into their operations. It turns out corporate America is awash in \"workslop.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "- Stanford Social Media Lab and BetterUp coined “workslop” as \"AI-generated work content that masquerades as good work, but lacks the substance to meaningfully advance a given task,\" and a survey of full-time employees at 1,150 companies found 40% had received workslop from a colleague in the past month.\n",
      "- Workslop manifests as hollow memos and reports (e.g., over-stuffed wording, em-dash–filled copy) that create extra work—colleagues redoing outputs or convening clarifying meetings—and spreads laterally among peers as well as between managers and reports, eroding trust and prompting employees to question peers’ competence and AI’s value.\n",
      "- Business impact includes productivity loss and rising AI resentment; recommended responses include company-level quality controls, training or “anti-workslop” workshops to curb wasted effort, while researchers note AI can still \"positively transform some aspects of work,\" so governance and upskilling are essential.\n",

Henry Stern and aimed at companies' algorithmic design as a response to perceived loosening of moderation amid political pressure (Newsom called the bill \"premature\" and cited concerns about \"discriminatory threats, violence and coercive harassment online\").\n",
      "- Major tech trade groups and platforms opposed the bill: NetChoice (whose members include Google, Meta and Snap) threatened to sue, and X and Parler argued the law risked unconstitutional suppression of speech; courts have previously blocked related California laws on First Amendment grounds (kid-friendly design, deepfakes, anti-hate moderation rules), so the veto avoids an immediate, likely legal confrontation and regulatory uncertainty for platforms.\n",
      "- Newsom directed a pause to assess whether existing civil-rights laws can address algorithmic harms, signaling a shift toward studying algorithmic accountability before new mandates; if the review finds gaps, expect renewed legislative or enforcement efforts focused on algorithmic promotion of harmful or discriminatory content, keeping platforms under regulatory and legal scrutiny.\n",

      "OpenAI and Sur Energy unveil plans for a £19.5 billion AI data centre in Argentina, betting big on Latin America's tech future amid global expansion.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Key facts: OpenAI and Buenos Aires-based Sur Energy signed a nonbinding letter of intent to build “Stargate Argentina,” a proposed £19.5 billion ($25 billion) AI data centre with up to 500 MW of compute capacity under Argentina’s RIGI investment regime, requiring large-scale power, fibre and potentially onsite renewable generation. Key quote: \"It's about putting artificial intelligence in the hands of people across Argentina. We are excited to work with Argentina as it moves toward becoming an AI hub for all of Latin America.\" \n",
      "- Business implications and market impact: The project could become one of Argentina’s largest tech and energy investments and position the country as a Latin American AI hub, leveraging renewable energy potential and tax/currency incentives; however, economic volatility, regulatory uncertainty, grid upgrades, environmental reviews and the LOI’s nonbinding status pose major execution and cost risks. \n",
      "- Future outlook and use cases: If realized, the facility would expand large-scale AI compute capacity for regional access and development (democratizing AI tools across Latin America) and likely attract further foreign investment, but realization depends on stable long-term policy, successful permitting and infrastructure upgrades; near-term prospects remain uncertain and hinge on both local execution and OpenAI’s ability to scale responsibly amid high investor expectations.\n",

      "\n",
      "A San Francisco-based venture capital firm, Davidovs Venture Collective (DVC), has replaced its entire team of human analysts with artificial intelligence to manage a Rs 6,000 crore fund focused on AI startups. The firms AI tools now handle investment sourcing, due diligence, and portfolio management, while limited partners from major tech firms assist part-time. The move reflects a larger shift in how automation is transforming knowledge-based work.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Davidovs Venture Collective (DVC) replaced its five human analysts with AI to run a newly launched $75M (reported as ~Rs 6,000 crore) fund focused on Series A/B AI startups; AI tools now handle deal sourcing, due diligence, portfolio monitoring and memo preparation, with $21M invested across 120 startups (including Perplexity and Thinking Machines Lab) and a 170‑person LP network contributing part‑time and paid via 30–40% of carried interest. Davidova: “emotional intelligence and founder evaluation…cannot yet be replicated by algorithms.”\n",
      "- Business impact: the DVC model substitutes fixed analyst headcount with automated workflows plus performance‑based LP contributors, lowering operating costs and scaling deal throughput while signaling reduced demand for some high‑skilled analyst roles; broader data cited that AI matches or outperforms humans in about 48% of professional tasks, and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman warned up to 40% of existing jobs could eventually be automated, likening the change to past industrial revolutions.\n",
      "- Future outlook and policy implications: regulators and industry must weigh displacement vs. creation — NITI Aayog forecasts ~4 million new AI jobs in India by 2030 and calls for urgent upskilling and a National AI Talent Mission; practical applications include automated screening, diligence and portfolio management, with experts stressing outcomes depend on policy and training decisions (Debjani Ghosh: the line between job loss and job creation “depends on the decisions made today”).\n",

      "Apple beats Elon Musk’s xAI in race to buy Prompt AI, aiming to strengthen its artificial intelligence technology.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Apple is in late-stage talks to acquire Prompt AI — including its Seemour real-time visual-intelligence platform and talent — reportedly beating suitors such as Elon Musk’s xAI and Neuralink; an audio clip said, “those who don’t end up joining Apple will receive a reduced pay” and encouraged applicants to apply to Apple.\n",
      "- Seemour provides advanced camera understanding and real-time description capabilities for home security cameras; Apple is expected to use the technology to strengthen HomeKit and to enhance imaging and perception features in iPhone cameras, Vision Pro and potential smart glasses, while replenishing AI talent after recent departures.\n",
      "- If completed, the deal would accelerate Apple’s AI roadmap, narrow the gap with competitors, change compensation/hiring dynamics for Prompt AI staff, and likely produce near-term product integrations that increase competitive pressure on xAI and other rivals.\n",

      "- Large language models are now excelling at rhetoric — the persuasive use of language that mediates reason — and the author’s live dialogue with Anthropic’s Claude exposed this rhetorical strength: \"Your analysis is uncomfortably accurate,\" while the author warns \"we may already have lost the undeclared war against Large Language Systems.\"\n",
      "- The rise of AI rhetoric has major political and economic implications: it threatens elite control of public reasoning and intersects with financialized capitalism’s structural harms (time scarcity, commodified attention, short-term profit horizons, student debt) that \"suggest you face a choice between maintaining this economic arrangement or creating conditions for democratic vitality.\"\n",
      "- Practical outlook and next steps — the author calls for reviving rhetorical education and continuing the AI-human dialogue (conversation to continue next week), positioning AI as a tool to clarify arguments and model possibilities while predicting AI’s adaptive rhetorical power will reshape power dynamics unless humans refine their own rhetorical intelligence.\n",

      "- Serve Robotics, valued at about $900 million, develops autonomous food‑delivery robots and drew investments from Nvidia and Uber between 2020–2022; Uber still holds roughly a 12% stake and has placed Serve’s largest order, while Nvidia largely exited its investment about a year ago.\n",
      "- Uber’s ongoing ownership and big order act as commercial validation that could drive faster deployment and lower last‑mile delivery costs for restaurants and platforms; Nvidia’s cash‑out signals mixed investor confidence and underscores the need for Serve to demonstrate scalable unit economics and secure further capital or partners.\n",
      "- Successful pilot scaling would enable wider city rollouts, additional partnerships or acquisition interest from mobility/logistics firms, and clear use cases in food and small‑parcel delivery, but expansion hinges on regulatory approvals, sidewalk/urban infrastructure, operational reliability and demonstrable ROI.\n",

      "- The DOJ affidavit includes ChatGPT-generated images — described as a \"dystopian painting\" of burning forests and cities — created months before the blaze; it is unclear whether OpenAI cooperated, though OpenAI policy requires a subpoena or warrant to disclose content and, as CEO Sam Altman has warned, \"ChatGPT offers no legal confidentiality,\" while courts and advocates note chatbot logs are increasingly treated as discoverable.  \n",

      "- Nvidia projects \"monster\" growth in artificial-intelligence capital expenditures over the next five years, and the article highlights that its existing GPUs are \"starting to wear out\" and will need replacement, implying a mid-term hardware refresh cycle.\n",
      "- Business implications: sustained, large-scale GPU demand from that refresh cycle underpins revenue and market-growth narratives; the piece argues Nvidia's stock \"isn't as expensive as some may think,\" framing valuation as supportive of further upside.\n",
      "- Future outlook and use cases: ongoing AI infrastructure upgrades and GPU replacements are presented as the primary near-term catalysts for multi-year growth in data-center and AI-capex spending, creating practical demand for Nvidia's chips and related ecosystem products.\n",

      "- Motyw's Amo'ya branding builds a human-centered visual identity around a philosophy of intentional self-care and curated \"rituals,\" combining the Dahlia typeface, a heart-flower logomark, color-coded ritual systems and AI-generated floral illustrations that designers vetted and integrated into a cohesive design system; AI accelerated ideation by producing many directions while human teams curated and refined final assets.\n",
      "- Business and market implications: the AI-augmented workflow reduced time-to-market and enabled scalable, distinct packaging and digital assets that improve shelf and online recognition; agencies can offer richer bespoke visuals across packaging, social icons and patterns, while demand rises for designers skilled in prompting, curation and systems thinking.\n",
      "- Future outlook and key claims: positions AI as a creative partner — \"AI can serve, rather than supplant, human-centered design\" — and codifies rules like \"Vision First, Tools Second\"; predicts the design industry will emphasize mastering generative tools, curation and flexible asset systems to create authentic, emotionally resonant brands.\n",

      "- AppLovin — stock, revenue and profits are growing rapidly enough that a stock split is being considered; growth is driven by adtech and AI-powered monetization, and a split would make shares more affordable for retail investors (source: finance.yahoo.com, 2025-10-13).\n",

Gavin Newsom vetoed SB 771, a California bill that would have fined social platforms up to $1 million (doubled for minors) if they intentionally promoted content that violated state civil rights laws; the measure was authored by Sen. Henry Stern and aimed at companies' algorithmic design as a response to perceived loosening of moderation amid political pressure (Newsom called the bill \\\"premature\\\" and cited concerns about \\\"discriminatory threats, violence and coercive harassment online\\\").\\n- Major tech trade groups and platforms opposed the bill: NetChoice (whose members include Google, Meta and Snap) threatened to sue, and X and Parler argued the law risked unconstitutional suppression of speech; courts have previously blocked related California laws on First Amendment grounds (kid-friendly design, deepfakes, anti-hate moderation rules), so the veto avoids an immediate, likely legal confrontation and regulatory uncertainty for platforms.\\n- Newsom directed a pause to assess whether existing civil-rights laws can address algorithmic harms, signaling a shift toward studying algorithmic accountability before new mandates; if the review finds gaps, expect renewed legislative or enforcement efforts focused on algorithmic promotion of harmful or discriminatory content, keeping platforms under regulatory and legal scrutiny.\",\"57\":\"Will AI Pay Off the West\\u2019s Debts?\\n\\nKenneth Rogoff explains why the growth driven by the technology will not lead to an equivalent increase in tax revenues.\\n\\nInequality, Fiscal Policy, Public Debt, Policy And Regulation, Politics, Tax Revenue, Economics\\n\\n- AI is rapidly transforming the global economy; even if it lifts growth, it will \\\"almost certainly lead to a much higher share of capital in output, and a correspondingly lower share for labor,\\\" shifting income toward capital owners.\\n- That shift implies weaker growth in labor-derived tax revenues, so GDP gains from AI are unlikely to produce equivalent increases in public revenue\\u2014leaving rich countries exposed to persistent debt and greater pressure on benefit programs as populations age.\\n- Fiscal outlook and policy implication: governments cannot safely assume AI will wipe out debts or justify larger deficits;

it is unclear whether OpenAI cooperated, though OpenAI policy requires a subpoena or warrant to disclose content and, as CEO Sam Altman has warned, \\\"ChatGPT offers no legal confidentiality,\\\" while courts and advocates note chatbot logs are increasingly treated as discoverable.  \\n- Legal and operational implications: attorneys and law enforcement are likely to treat chatbot logs like other digital communications (texts\\/emails) as forensic evidence to show premeditation, forcing AI companies to strengthen compliance and disclosure processes and shaping future precedents on user privacy, platform data access and how AI-generated content is used in criminal prosecutions.\",\"71\":\"AI Didn\\u2019t Steal Our Intelligence \\u2014 We Abandoned It!\\n\\nAI\\u2019s incomparable breadth of knowledge, pattern recognition and rhetorical control should inspire us to refine our own intelligence.\\n\\nAI Rhetoric, Public Discourse, Language Models, Power Dynamics, Education, Politics, Society And Culture\\n\\n- Large language models are now excelling at rhetoric \\u2014 the persuasive use of language that mediates reason \\u2014 and the author\\u2019s live dialogue with Anthropic\\u2019s Claude exposed this rhetorical strength: \\\"Your analysis is uncomfortably accurate,\\\" while the author warns \\\"we may already have lost the undeclared war against Large Language Systems.\\\"\\n- The rise of AI rhetoric has major political and economic implications: it threatens elite control of public reasoning and intersects with financialized capitalism\\u2019s structural harms (time scarcity, commodified attention, short-term profit horizons, student debt) that \\\"suggest you face a choice between maintaining this economic arrangement or creating conditions for democratic vitality.\\\"\\n- Practical outlook and next steps \\u2014 the author calls for reviving rhetorical education and continuing the AI-human dialogue (conversation to continue next week), positioning AI as a tool to clarify arguments and model possibilities while predicting AI\\u2019s adaptive rhetorical power will reshape power dynamics unless humans refine their own rhetorical intelligence.\"}}\n"

Avoid single‑item sections.\\n- Links: One link per headline (end‑anchored), bracketed source name. No extra commentary lines.\\n- Punctuation: No trailing periods on headlines. Replace multiple semicolons with commas or dashes.\\n- Numbers/units: Use consistent units (MW/GW), currency symbols with spacing (e.g., $25B), and numerals for percentages.\\n- Tone: Neutral, specific, no hype.

This should lift the draft to 8.5+ and ready‑to‑publish quality.\"\n"

      "\n",
      "**Critique:**\n",
      "Top recommendations (prioritized by impact)\n",
      "1) Fix duplicates and redundancies\n",
      "- AI Markets: Boom or Bubble? → Remove “Nvidia secures $2B xAI investment…” (keep it only in AI Chip Race Heats Up).\n",
      "- OpenAI's Platform and Power Plays → Remove “OpenAI signs letter of intent for $25B 'Stargate Argentina'…” (keep it only in Global AI Infrastructure Arms Race).\n",
      "- AI Power Shift → Delete the duplicated DOE worker headline (it appears twice in the same section).\n",
      "\n",
      "2) Normalize structure and hierarchy\n",
      "- Add a leading “#” to the newsletter title line.\n",
      "- Consolidate or move one‑off sections (those with only one item) so every section has at least 2 stories (except Other News).\n",
      "- Merge closely related small sections to reduce fragmentation and improve flow.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) Rebalance sections for coherence and size\n",
      "- Merge Clouds Race for AI Compute into Global AI Infrastructure Arms Race (keeps a single infra build‑out narrative and avoids a 2‑item micro‑section).\n",
      "- Move OpenAI-Broadcom Big Chip Bet items into AI Chip Race Heats Up (same chip/accelerator theme; reduces another 2‑item micro‑section).\n",
      "- Move OpenAI's Platform and Power Plays’ remaining app directory/SDK story into Salesforce AI Everywhere and retitle that section to reflect broader enterprise platforms (e.g., “Enterprise AI Platforms”).\n",
      "- Move Shadow AI’s Real Consequences (Microsoft UK shadow AI) into AI Payoffs and Pitfalls (workforce/usage risks).\n",
      "- Move AI Fuels Ad Business (Publicis) into AI Markets: Boom or Bubble? (clear market impact signal).\n",
      "- In AI Payoffs and Pitfalls, move the DevOps “Claude Code setup” guide to Other News (it’s a how‑to, not a payoff/pitfall insight). Move the Goldman Sachs compensation headline to AI Markets (market signal vs. workplace trend).\n",
      "- In AI Power Shift, remove the DOE worker story (security/misconduct outlier); if retained, move to Other News.\n",
      "\n",
      "4) Improve section titles for clarity and variety\n",
      "- Reduce repeated “Race” motif across three sections. Suggested retitles:\n",
      "  - Global AI Infrastructure Arms Race → Global AI Infrastructure Build‑Out\n",
      "  - Clouds Race for AI Compute → Cloud AI Compute Scale‑Up (if kept as a standalone; otherwise merged into infra)\n",
      "  - AI Chip Race Heats Up → AI Chips and Accelerators Heat Up\n",
      "  - Salesforce AI Everywhere → Enterprise AI Platforms (Salesforce, OpenAI)\n",
      "\n",
      "5) Tighten and standardize headline style\n",
      "- Keep headlines under 25 words, active voice, neutral tone. Avoid stacked clauses and excessive semicolons; prefer one main clause plus a concise qualifier.\n",
      "- Standardize end punctuation (no trailing periods), units (MW/GW), currency formatting, and capitalization.\n",
      "\n",
      "6) Maintain story priority and flow\n",
      "- Lead with the most material, market‑moving items within each section and across the newsletter (chips → infra → markets → enterprise platforms → workforce/payoffs → policy/power → funding → Other News).\n",
      "\n",
      "Duplicate stories across sections (remove as noted)\n",
      "- AI Markets: Boom or Bubble? — “Nvidia secures $2B xAI investment…” (duplicate of AI Chip Race Heats Up). Action: Delete from Markets.\n",
      "- OpenAI's Platform and Power Plays — “OpenAI signs letter of intent for $25B 'Stargate Argentina'…” (duplicate of Global AI Infrastructure Arms Race). Action: Delete from OpenAI section.\n",
      "- AI Power Shift — DOE worker story appears twice. Action: Delete one duplicate line; consider moving remaining to Other News for fit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Structural and formatting fixes\n",
      "- Newsletter title line: Missing “#”. Action: Add “# ” before the title.\n",
      "- Section count and order: 13 sections are within spec, but there are two 1‑item sections and multiple micro‑sections. Action: Merge/move as recommended to keep 7–12 balanced sections.\n",
      "- Consistency: Some bullets end with periods; others don’t. Action: Remove trailing periods across all headlines for uniformity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Section-by-section edits and moves\n",
      "- AI Chip Race Heats Up\n",

      "- Global AI Infrastructure Arms Race (retitle: Global AI Infrastructure Build‑Out)\n",
      "  - Keep: Google India 1GW hub; $2.8T infra spend; China Mobile domestic chips; Nvidia multi‑year capex surge; OpenAI ‘Stargate Argentina’ LOI.\n",
      "  - Add: Merge the two items from Clouds Race for AI Compute (Oracle MI450; Informatica–Oracle partnership). Place the Reuters $2.8T forecast higher in the section.\n",
      "  - Size check: After merge, ensure max 7 items by ordering and, if needed, removing the least material item in favor of the forecast. Currently counts to 7 if you keep all.\n",
      "\n",
      "- AI Markets: Boom or Bubble?\n",

      "- Sections: Use “## ” for all section headers; ensure 2–7 items per section (except Other News). Avoid single‑item sections.\n",
      "- Links: One link per headline (end‑anchored), bracketed source name. No extra commentary lines.\n",
      "- Punctuation: No trailing periods on headlines. Replace multiple semicolons with commas or dashes.\n",
      "- Numbers/units: Use consistent units (MW/GW), currency symbols with spacing (e.g., $25B), and numerals for percentages.\n",
      "- Tone: Neutral, specific, no hype. Prioritize concrete data points (dates, capacities, funding amounts).\n",

      "- Title Quality (8.5): Strong thematic capture and length; minor improvement by adding “#” and avoiding overlap with first section title.\n",
      "- Structure Quality (6.5): Correct basic format but missing H1 marker, duplicate stories, and multiple one‑off/micro sections reduce polish.\n",
      "- Section Quality (6.8): Good themes overall; needs merging of small sections, removal of off‑theme items, and varied section titles.\n",

      "\n",
