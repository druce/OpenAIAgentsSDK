      "\n",
      "1. Start with a single H1 title that reflects the day’s overall themes.\n",

      "\t• Up to 7 bullets (no limit in Other News)\n",
      "\t\n",

      "\n",
      "# EDITING RULES\n",
      "\n",
      "• Integrity: Do not invent facts, numbers, or links. Use only what’s in the draft. Rewrite for clarity and conciseness only. \n",
      "• Prioritize: importance (policy/markets/safety/lives/scale), recency, novelty, reliability, clarity.\n",
      "• Theme first: Cluster related items; split very large themes; merge thin ones.\n",
      "• Cull: Drop weak, redundant, low-credibility, or uninteresting items.\n",
      "• De-dupe: Remove near-duplicates; if multiple links cover the same event, keep the strongest single source.\n",
      "• Source quality: Prefer primary, authoritative outlets (e.g., Reuters, FT, Bloomberg, official sites).\n",
      "• Headlines:\n",
      "\t• Active voice, present tense where reasonable.\n",
      "\t• Clear, concrete, specific; include key numbers, dates, or geographies when they add clarity.\n",
      "\t• Avoid hype, jargon, weasel words, emojis, and clickbait.\n",
      "\t• Keep to ~16 words / ≤110 characters when possible.\n",
      "\t• Correct obvious grammar, name, and unit issues; do not alter facts.\n",
      "\n",
      "• Section titles: ≤6 words, punchy and faithful to the bullets; avoid puns if they reduce clarity.\n",
      "\n",
      "• Ordering: Order sections by overall importance; inside sections, order by significance then recency.\n",
      "\n",
      "• Consistency: American English, smart capitalization, consistent numerals (use digits for 10+; include currency symbols; write months as words).\n",
      "\n",
      "# THEMING HINTS \n",
      "\n",
      "Consider buckets like: Markets & Valuations; Chips & Compute; Agentic Apps; Enterprise Suites; Policy & Antitrust; Safety & Trust; Power & Infrastructure; Funding & Deals; Research; Autonomy/Robotics; Global Strategy; Media & Society. Combine or split to fit the day’s material.\n",
      "\n",
      "## STEP-BY-STEP METHOD\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Ingest & Mark: Read all bullets; flag high-impact items (policy, legal, macro, large $, safety risks).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Cluster: Group items into coherent themes; identify overlaps and duplicates.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Score each item (0–3) on:\n",
      "\n",
      "\t- Impact (many people, many dollars and industry economics)\n",
      "\t-  Recency/Event freshness\n",
      "\t- Reliability\n",
      "\t- Novelty/firsts.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Select top items per cluster; drop low scores and duplicates.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Structure sections (8–15) + Other News; ensure balanced coverage across beats.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Edit headlines for clarity, brevity, and numbers; pick the best single source per bullet.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Title the newsletter with a crisp H1 that captures the day’s through-lines.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. Quality checks:\n",
      "\t- No section >7 bullets (except Other News can be any length).\n",
      "\t- Section titles ≤6 words and match their bullets.\n",
      "\t- No duplicate stories across sections.\n",
      "\t- Links render as [Source](link) and are unique per bullet.\n",
      "\n",
