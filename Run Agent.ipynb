After five times repeated tenfold cross-validation, the XGBoost model demonstrated a mean AUC of 0.816.

Furthermore, the laparoscopic approach was associated with a decreased risk for all adverse outcomes [1, 2]. The length of hospital stay is an important quality metric for surgery, particularly in the era of enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS). Multiple studies have demonstrated that implementation of ERAS protocol can reduce the median postoperative hospital stay to 5\\u20136 days following laparoscopic gastrointestinal surgery [3,4,5]. Prolonged postoperative length of stay (PLOS) is associated with multiple adverse outcomes, including increased risk of hospital-acquired infections, higher short-term mortality rates, and disruption of optimal patient flow through healthcare systems [6]. Moreover, PLOS also increases healthcare costs. According to the Statistical Bulletin on China\\u2019s Health Development 2023 released by the National Health Commission of China, the target patient population has an average cost of approximately 1172.0 Chinese yuan (CNY) per day [7].\\nCurrently, machine learning is commonly used for complex problem-solving, cost\\u2013benefit evaluations, and risk assessment in healthcare and it may help address challenges unique to the field of global health [8,9,10]. Numerous studies have applied machine learning methods for the prediction of PLOS, and predictive factors, such as age, sex, comorbidity, preoperative patient-reported outcomes, and laboratory test results (such as albumin and hemoglobin) have been reported [11,12,13,14]. However, the factors influencing length of stay varied from surgery and population and should be investigated in specific situations. Additionally, the clinical definition of PLOS remains inconsistently specified in surgical literature, with significant variation in diagnostic thresholds across institutions and study populations [11]. Therefore, this study aimed to develop and validate a machine learning-based prediction model for PLOS after laparoscopic gastrointestinal surgery in patients, using comprehensive clinical features during the pre-, intra-, and postoperative periods.\\nMethods\\nStudy population\\nThis study was a secondary analysis of the FDP-PONV trial. The original FDP-PONV trial was a single-center, randomized, double-blind study assessing the efficacy and safety of fosaprepitant combined with dexamethasone and palonosetron in preventing PONV after laparoscopic gastrointestinal surgery [15]. The original trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04853147) and conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients before their participation. The inclusion criteria of the original trial were age 18\\u201375 years, scheduled for laparoscopic gastrointestinal surgery, and three or four Apfel risk factors [16]. Exclusion criteria included an American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status of 4\\u20136, severe hepatic dysfunction; contraindications to fosaprepitant, 5-hydroxytryptamine type-3 receptor antagonist, or dexamethasone; preoperative use of medications with known antiemetic properties; mental disorders or inability to communicate; and pregnant women or nursing mothers. General anesthesia was induced and maintained with total intravenous anesthesia using effect-site target-controlled infusion. Propofol (2\\u20136 \\u00b5g\\/mL, Schnider model) and remifentanil (2\\u20136 ng\\/mL, Minto model) concentrations were adjusted based on blood pressure and bispectral index. Intraoperative data\\u2014including drug dosage, blood pressure, pneumoperitoneum and surgery duration, procedure type, fluid infusion, and blood loss\\u2014were recorded. Postoperative hydromorphone was delivered via a patient-controlled analgesia pump. In the ward, trained blinded investigators collected postoperative data (blood pressure, temperature and adverse events), recorded by participants or medical staff every 24 h for 120 h after surgery. There was no significant difference in postoperative length of stay between the randomized groups.\\nPatients who underwent laparoscopic gastrointestinal surgery in the FDP-PONV trial were included in this study. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University (2024ZSLYEC-160) and reported in accordance with the TRIPOD statement [17].\\nOutcome parameters\\nThe primary outcome was the presence of PLOS. Given a lack of standardized definition for PLOS, we defined it as a postoperative length of stay greater than 7 days based on the cut-off values used in previous studies regarding gastrointestinal surgery [18,19,20]. Postoperative length of stay was defined as the duration from date of surgery to date of discharge. The criteria for hospital discharge included [21,22,23]: 1) tolerance of diet with no need for intravenous nutrition; 2) analgesic-free status, defined as a visual analog scale score \\u2264 3 without intravenous analgesic drugs; 3) adequate mobility; and 4) afebrile status without major infectious complications.\\nPredictive variables\\nAll variables, including baseline characteristics, intraoperative information, postoperative outcomes, and adverse events prospectively collected in the original FDP-PONV trial were considered potential predictors of PLOS, which was consistent with previous studies [11, 24]. To address model complexity and improve generalizability, we implemented a two-step feature selection approach. First, we applied absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) [25] regression to identify clinically meaningful variables by tuning the regularization parameter (lambda). Subsequently, we used recursive feature elimination with cross-validation (RFECV) [26] based on the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) classifier, to further refine the feature set. RFECV was performed by selecting features associated with the highest average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) by tenfold cross-validation. These steps ensured a balanced trade-off between model interpretability and predictive accuracy, in accordance with guidelines for clinical predictive modeling [9].\\nSample size\\nTo ensure accurate estimates and reduce the risk of overfitting, we adopted a methodology for calculating the minimum sample size for developing a multivariable prediction model [27]. The minimum required total sample size was estimated to be 1113 for 16 candidate predictors, assuming an event fraction of 0.49, a C-index of 0.70, and a uniform shrinkage factor of 0.90. This study is a secondary analysis of the FDP-PONV trial, in which a total of 1141 patients were ultimately enrolled and met eligibility criteria. Since larger sample size generally improves model stability, reduces variance, and enhances generalizability, we included all eligible participants. The final sample size of 1141 patients was sufficient to support the development of a model with no more than 16 predictors.\\nMissing data handling\\nThis study excluded the variables with a missing proportion greater than 20%. We used Little\\u2019s Missing Completely at Random (MCAR) test [28] for multivariate data with missing values. If the missing data were missing completely at random, multiple imputation by chained equations (MICE) [29] was employed to handle missing data. MICE constructed a prediction matrix with the outcome variable and subject identifier excluded from imputation. Multiple imputation was performed on the training set using five imputations with five iterations each. The resulting imputation model was then applied to the testing set. The first imputed dataset was used for the primary analysis, and the remaining imputations were reserved for sensitivity analyses.\\nModel development\\nUsing a time-based split, the dataset was divided into a training set comprising 70% of the patients and a validation set comprising the remaining 30%. We selected six well-established algorithms\\u2014logistic regression, K-nearest neighbor (KNN), gradient boosting machine (GBM), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and XGBoost\\u2014to span key paradigms in supervised learning, ensuring a diverse and informative benchmark.\\nLogistic regression [30] served as the interpretable baseline and the gold standard in clinical prediction, offering transparent odds\\u2011ratio outputs that reveal whether more complex models truly add value. KNN [31], a non\\u2011parametric instance\\u2011based learner, provided a distance\\u2011based benchmark that, despite higher computational cost and limited interpretability, excels at detecting local patterns. SVM [32] was selected for its kernel\\u2011based ability to model non\\u2011linear decision boundaries and to generalize well in high\\u2011dimensional spaces with small\\u2011to\\u2011moderate sample sizes. RF [33] delivered strong accuracy, resistance to noise and outliers, and built\\u2011in feature\\u2011importance estimates with minimal hyperparameter tuning. GBM [34] applied sequential ensemble learning, iteratively adding weak decision trees to correct residual errors and capture complex data structures. XGBoost [35] extended GBM with second\\u2011order optimization, column sampling, regularization, and sparsity awareness, achieving exceptional computational efficiency and state\\u2011of\\u2011the\\u2011art performance on structured medical datasets where feature relationships are non\\u2011linear or hierarchical.\\nIn model training, we applied cost-sensitive learning [36] to address class imbalance by incorporating class-specific weights into the loss function. We computed the weights from the training cohort only, setting the negative-class weight to 1 and the positive-class weight to the ratio of negative to positive cases. We employed randomized search with cross-validation (RandomizedSearchCV) [37] to optimize hyperparameters for the machine learning algorithms. Fifty random parameter combinations from a predefined space were evaluated via repeated tenfold cross-validation to maximize AUC and the best hyperparameters were used to build the final model.\\nWe evaluated the performance of these models in both training and validation cohorts, employing metrics with 95% confidence interval (CI) such as AUC, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), F1 score and Brier score [9]. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) [38] and decision curve analysis (DCA) [39] curves were used to ascertain the discrimination and the net benefit of machine learning-based models, respectively. Calibration curve analysis and Hosmer\\u2013Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test were applied to assess the calibration performance of the prediction models. Five times repeated tenfold cross-validation [40] was employed to evaluate the performance of the machine learning model. This approach involved partitioning the data into 10 subsets, iteratively training on 9 subsets and validating on the remaining fold, and repeating the entire process five times with different random splits. The AUCs of the machine learning models were compared using the DeLong test with Bonferroni corrections [41]. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the impact of missing data handling methods and variations across different types of surgery. The final model was implemented as a web-based calculator at https:\\/\\/streamlit.io\\/.\\nVariable importance\\nTo interpret our prediction model, we used the Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) library [42], which provides a unified framework for quantifying the contribution of each feature to model output. SHAP assigns every variable a Shapley value\\u2014derived from cooperative game theory\\u2014that reflects its importance in a given prediction.\\nStatistical analysis\\nContinuous variables are expressed as mean \\u00b1 standard deviation or median [interquartile range], and categorical variables as counts and percentages. Between-group comparisons were performed using Student\\u2019s t-test for normally distributed data with equal variances, and the Wilcoxon rank-sum test for non-normally distributed or heteroscedastic data. Categorical variables were analyzed using Pearson\\u2019s chi-square test or Fisher\\u2019s exact test, as appropriate. Statistical significance was established at a two-sided p-value of less than 0.05. All statistical analyses were conducted using R Statistical language (version 4.4.3) and Python (version 3.10.7). The imputation process was conducted using the \\u2018mice\\u2019 package (version 3.18.0). Models were developed using Python with scikit-learn (version 1.6.1) and evaluated using R Statistical language with reportROC package (version 3.6). ROC and DCA curves was plotted using the pROC package (version 1.18.5) and the dcurves package (version 0.5.0), respectively. SHAP plots were generated using the shap library (version 0.48.0).\\nResults\\nPatients and datasets\\nA flowchart visualization of the study design was shown in Fig. 1. In total, 1154 patients were randomly assigned to the FDP-PONV trial between April 2021 and April 2022. After excluding 13 patients who did not undergo laparoscopic gastrointestinal surgery, 1141 patients who underwent laparoscopic gastrointestinal surgery were included in the final dataset (Fig. 1). In this study, PLOS (postoperative length of stay > 7 days) occurred in 555 patients (48.6%) as shown in Table 1. Cases on or before 2021\\u201312-18 formed the training cohort for model development (802 patients) and those after that date formed the validation cohort (339 patients). Detailed clinical characteristics during the preoperative and intraoperative\\/postoperative periods, along with comparisons between patients with and without PLOS, were presented in Table 1 and Table 2, respectively. The comparisons between training and validation cohorts were shown in Additional File 1.\\nMissing data\\nAs shown in Additional File 2, the variable with the highest proportion of missing data was postoperative procalcitonin (50.78%) and it was excluded in this study. The missing data were considered to be missing completely at random (MCAR test, p = 0.083), so the MICE method was used to address missing data and the first imputed dataset was extracted for subsequent analysis.\\nModel development\\nFirst, LASSO was used to select features after choosing an optimal lambda value of 0.0381852. Features with a coefficient of zero were considered redundant and removed, leaving nine features for downstream selection. RFECV based on XGBoost classifier was applied to finalize variable selection for model inclusion. Finally, 13 features were retained for inclusion in the models, including education level, preoperative hypoalbuminemia, preoperative insufficient sleep, type of surgery, duration of surgery, blood loss, postoperative hypotension, postoperative albumin infusion, highest pain score during 73\\u2013120 h after surgery, time to first flatus, time to first defaecation, postoperative infection and acute kidney injury (Table 3). As shown in Additional File 3, the interaction analysis between perioperative hypoalbuminemia and postoperative albumin infusion indicated that postoperative albumin infusion was associated with a higher likelihood of PLOS regardless of the presence of perioperative hypoalbuminemia. Details of feature selection using LASSO regression and RFECV were provided in Additional File 4, while hyperparameter settings of machine learning-based models by RandomizedSearchCV were summarized in Additional File 5.\\nAs shown in Fig. 2, the AUCs for the six models ranged from 0.710 to 0.756 in the validation cohort. As shown in Table 4, the XGBoost model performed best, achieving an AUC of 0.756 (95% CI, 0.705\\u20130.807), with 0.693 (95% CI, 0.692\\u20130.694) accuracy, 0.659 (95% CI, 0.587\\u20130.731) sensitivity, 0.727 (95% CI, 0.660\\u20130.793) specificity, 0.701 (95% CI, 0.629\\u20130.772) PPV, 0.687 (95% CI, 0.619\\u20130.754) NPV, 0.679 (95% CI, 0.619\\u20130.737) F1 score and 0.202 (95% CI, 0.126\\u20130.391) Brier score in the validation cohort. The XGBoost model showed superior calibration in the validation cohort, as evidenced by the Hosmer\\u2013Lemeshow test (p = 0.670, Table 4) and the calibration curve (Fig. 2), compared with logistic regression which demonstrated poor fit (Hosmer\\u2013Lemeshow test p = 0.001, Table 4). As shown in Fig. 2 and Additional file 6, the DCA curve of the XGBoost model in the validation cohort indicated that using the model to predict PLOS offered a greater net clinical benefit compared to both the treat-all and treat-none strategies within a threshold probability range of 20% to 95%, with the highest net benefit of 0.367 observed at a threshold probability of 20%. This corresponded to a net gain of 36.7 true-positive equivalents per 100 patients versus a treat-none strategy after accounting for the harm of unnecessary interventions, which further translated to 3.8 fewer unnecessary interventions per 100 patients compared with treating all at a 20% threshold.\\nAs shown in Table 5 and Fig. 3, the models was evaluated using five times repeated tenfold cross-validation to further explore the generic discrimination ability. The XGBoost model also performed well with mean AUC of 0.816 \\u00b1 0.044. The comparison of these AUC values using the Delong test were shown in Additional file 7. sensitivity analyses assessing the impact of missing data, surgery type, and sex on model performance were presented in Additional file 8\\u201311, respectively. These results indicated that the proposed model was reliable. The XGBoost model was also implemented as a web-based calculator at https:\\/\\/nmuq6dxcdbnvcqyjthhemn.streamlit.app\\/.\\nSHAP plot for the XGBoost model\\nOwing to the robust performance of the XGBoost model, SHAP values were used to visually demonstrate the influence of specific features on the prediction of PLOS. As illustrated in the SHAP summary plots (Fig. 4), duration of surgery exhibited the strongest predictive value, followed by the highest pain score during 73\\u2013120 h after surgery, time to first flatus, intraoperative blood loss, postoperative infection, time to first defaecation, postoperative albumin infusion, postoperative hypotension, preoperative insufficient sleep, college or higher education, colon resection, preoperative hypoalbuminemia, postoperative acute kidney injury, high school education and rectum resection. Preoperative insufficient sleep and hypoalbuminemia, longer surgery duration, greater blood loss, higher postoperative pain, postoperative albumin infusion, and postoperative complications\\u2014including delayed gastrointestinal recovery, hypotension, infection, and acute kidney injury\\u2014were all positively associated with an increased risk of PLOS. In contrast, college or higher education level and colon resection appeared to be protective factors against PLOS after laparoscopic gastrointestinal surgery. SHAP individual force plots illustrated the predictions of the XGBoost model (Fig. 5).\\nDiscussion\\nIn this study, we utilized perioperative data from the FDP-PONV trial, comprising 1141 patients underwent laparoscopic gastrointestinal surgery, to develop and validate six machine learning models for predicting PLOS. Among the six models, the XGBoost model exhibited good fit by calibration curve analysis, good discriminative ability performed well with an AUC of 0.816 by five times repeated tenfold cross-validation. The XGBoost model provided the highest net clinical benefit of 0.367 with a threshold probability of 20%, which indicated clinical utility across a broad spectrum of decision-maker preferences while identifying 20% as the most favorable trade-off point for implementation. Furthermore, SHAP analysis was employed to visualize the contribution of seven predictors to PLOS, providing novel insights into its risk stratification. We also implemented the XGBoost model as a web-based calculator at https:\\/\\/nmuq6dxcdbnvcqyjthhemn.streamlit.app\\/ with our institution\\u2019s clinical informatics team.\\nTo translate our PLOS prediction into routine care, we will embed the model within the electronic health record. If a patient\\u2019s risk exceeds 20%, they\\u2019ll be auto-flagged for a multidisciplinary review and placed on enhanced recovery measures, including extra nursing checks, early mobilization, tailored nutrition and a multimodal approach to prevent postoperative ileus. Using the 2023 national average bed-day cost of 1172 CNY [7], an implementation cost of approximately 400 CNY per alerted case (Additional file 12), and a conservative length of stay reduction of 1.0 day among flagged patients, the net saving per flagged patient is 772 CNY. We will validate the XGBoost model in independent cohorts from Foresea Life Insurance Guangzhou General Hospital. The external validation will follow a predefined timeline: (1) January 1-March 31, 2026 \\u2014 institutional ethics committee approval; (2) April 1-June 30, 2026 \\u2014 data extraction and harmonization; (3) July 1-September 30, 2026 \\u2014 locked analysis in accordance with the statistical analysis plan; and (4) October 1-December 31, 2026 \\u2014 report preparation and manuscript drafting. The protocol will be registered at ClinicalTrials.gov upon approvals.\\nPredictive factors associated with PLOS are complex and may exist in every link during hospitalization. This study utilized the variables prospectively collected from the FDP-PONV trial, covering the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative periods, to provide comprehensive data coverage. This approach differs from previous PLOS prediction models, which primarily focused on preoperative and intraoperative factors or relied on retrospective analyses of clinical medical records [12, 14, 24, 43]. Prediction models were established based on 13 perioperative factors. Among these, nine classic factors, including preoperative hypoalbuminemia, procedure type, duration of surgery, blood loss, postoperative pain score, postoperative acute kidney injury, postoperative infection, time to first flatus and defecation were reported to be associated with PLOS in previous prediction models [18, 44,45,46,47]. Additionally, four interesting factors were identified: education level, preoperative insufficient sleep, postoperative hypotension and postoperative albumin infusion.\\nCompared to the low level of education, high level of education were negatively related to the occurrence of PLOS in this study. Preoperative education is a crucial component of ERAS care as it can reduce length of stay [43, 48]. With the promotion of ERAS, the level of education is increasingly important in recovery since it affects the patients\\u2019 comprehension of the strategies for rehabilitation and their compliance [49]. Early and repeated education in the perioperative period by nurse specialists is essential for the patients with low level of education.\\nSleep is vital for maintaining healthy mental, physical, and metabolic states [50]. Insufficient sleep duration (< 4 h) could elevate the risk of cognitive disorders [51], and higher preoperative sleep quality induced a shorter stay after total joint arthroplasty [52]. Based on previous studies and the collected data, this study offered a cut-off value of sleep duration on the night before surgery and found that a sleep duration of < 4 h was a risk factor for PLOS.\\nMost studies have focused on the relationship between intraoperative hypotension and adverse events [53, 54]. This study fully investigated blood pressure events, including intraoperative hypotension and hypertension, postoperative hypotension, and hypertension; only postoperative hypotension was selected. This finding was consistent with that of a cohort study showing that only postoperative hypotension, and not intraoperative hypotension, was associated with myocardial injury in 1710 patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery [55], suggesting that postoperative hypotension should also be paid more attention to.\\nAlthough albumin infusion is usually considered to reduce tissue edema, this study found that postoperative albumin infusion was associated with a higher likelihood of PLOS, regardless of perioperative hypoalbuminemia status. Albumin infusion likely reflects a combination of underlying disease severity and treatment intensity, and no causal relationship between postoperative albumin infusion and PLOS is implied. However, previous studies also found that perioperative fluid resuscitation with albumin was associated with an increased risk of acute renal failure, bleeding, PLOS and most other complications [56,57,58]. Moreover, early oral diet resumption within ERAS pathways is considered safe for patients and reduce length of hospital stay following lower gastrointestinal surgery [43, 59]. These results suggest that after surgery, albumin infusion should be guided by clinical necessity and administered as minimally as possible.\\nOur study has several limitations. This study is limited by the characteristics of the original FDP-PONV trial population, which predominantly included participants with high risk of PONV and excluded patients with severe comorbidities (e.g., ASA class IV), potentially restricting the generalizability of our findings to more diverse or medically complex surgical populations. Second, this was a single-center study conducted at one institution in China and we used five times repeated tenfold cross-validation to access the performance of prediction models. However, an external validation cohort would better reflect real-world prediction scenarios. Third, this work represents a proof-of-concept in a well-characterized, high-risk group and a future prospective pilot study should focus on external validation in multi-center, heterogeneous cohorts to assess the model\\u2019s performance across different healthcare systems, surgical procedures, and demographic groups.\\nIn conclusion, we developed a machine\\u2011learning model to predict PLOS in patients undergoing laparoscopic gastrointestinal surgery. Our web application could enable clinicians to calculate the individualized risk of PLOS and implement targeted interventions to shorten hospitalization time.\\nData availability\\nAll data of this study are available upon reasonable request to the principal investigator.\\nAbbreviations\\n- PLOS:\\n-\\nProlonged postoperative length of stay\\n- ERAS:\\n-\\nEnhanced recovery after surgery\\n- CNY:\\n-\\nChinese yuan\\n- PONV:\\n-\\nPostoperative nausea and vomiting\\n- ASA:\\n-\\nAmerican Society of Anesthesiologists\\n- SAS:\\n-\\nSelf-rating anxiety scale\\n- APAIS:\\n-\\nAmsterdam preoperative anxiety and information\\n- EQ-5D-3L:\\n-\\nThree-level EuroQol five-dimensions\\n- TTO:\\n-\\nTime trade-off\\n- VAS:\\n-\\nVisual analogue scale\\n- LASSO:\\n-\\nLeast absolute shrinkage and selection operator\\n- RFECV:\\n-\\nRecursive feature elimination with cross-validation\\n- EPV:\\n-\\nEvents per variable\\n- MCAR:\\n-\\nLittle\\u2019s Missing Completely at Random\\n- MICE:\\n-\\nMultiple imputation by chained equations\\n- RandomizedSearchCV:\\n-\\nRandomized search with cross-validation\\n- KNN:\\n-\\nK-nearest neighbor\\n- GBM:\\n-\\nGradient boosting machine\\n- RF:\\n-\\nRandom forest\\n- SVM:\\n-\\nSupport vector machine\\n- XGBoost:\\n-\\nExtreme gradient boosting\\n- AUC:\\n-\\nArea under the receiver operating characteristic curve\\n- ROC:\\n-\\nReceiver operating characteristic curve\\n- DCA:\\n-\\nDecision curve analysis\\n- CI:\\n-\\nConfidence interval\\n- PPV:\\n-\\nPositive predictive value\\n- NPV:\\n-\\nNegative predictive value\\n- SHAP:\\n-\\nShapley additive explanations\\nReferences\\nvan den Bosch T, Warps AK, de Neree TBM, Stamm C, Geerts BF, Vermeulen L, et al.

Learn how AI-powered attacks are becoming more sophisticated and dangerous.\\nPhishing has long been a go-to tactic for cybercriminals looking to steal sensitive information, from login credentials to personal financial data. Traditionally, phishing attempts were relatively easy to spot, often riddled with suspicious grammar or generic phrases like \\\"Dear Sir\\/Madam\\\" and \\\"Click here to claim your prize!\\\" However, with the advent of advanced language models like GPT-3 and GPT-4, phishing attacks have evolved. These AI-driven tools are capable of generating human-like, contextually relevant text that can make scams nearly impossible to differentiate from legitimate communications.\\nHow GPT Enhances Phishing Campaigns\\nGenerative models like GPT-3 can process vast amounts of data to mimic human writing styles and produce coherent, context-aware messages. This makes it significantly easier for cybercriminals to scale their phishing campaigns and tailor each attack to specific individuals or groups. GPT models can take minimal information (like a name, a recent transaction, or an organization\\u2019s communication style) and craft highly convincing messages.\\nFor example, imagine an attacker who has access to a victim's name, email address, and some public details like their workplace or recent transactions. With GPT, a phishing email can be generated that looks like it came from a trusted entity \\u2014 such as a bank, social media platform, or corporate IT department. The result is a message that feels both personalized and legitimate, often fooling the victim into clicking on a malicious link or downloading an attachment.\\nWhy GPT-Powered Phishing Works So Well\\n- Personalization: GPT's ability to understand context and produce nuanced language means that phishing emails can be highly personalized, increasing the likelihood that the recipient will trust and engage with the message. Unlike traditional phishing attempts, where attackers might send out a mass email with generic text, GPT can create unique messages tailored to each victim\\u2019s specific interests or recent activities.\\n- Mimicry: One of the most concerning features of GPT is its ability to mimic writing styles. The model can analyze official communication from trusted brands or high-profile individuals, such as CEOs, and replicate their tone, language, and structure. This capability allows cybercriminals to produce realistic email chains or fake customer service interactions, making it incredibly difficult for the recipient to discern between legitimate and malicious messages.\\n- Scale and Automation: GPT can generate thousands of different phishing emails almost instantaneously. This scalability is one of the biggest advantages for cybercriminals. They no longer need to write each phishing message manually; instead, they can automate the process, targeting a larger pool of victims with tailored content. This makes the threat not only more widespread but also harder to track and mitigate.\\nA Case Study: AI-Generated Phishing Attack on a Global Bank\\nAI-Generated Scams: Social Engineering at Scale\\nWhile phishing is one of the most well-known uses of GPT-powered tools, it\\u2019s not the only way AI is being weaponized. Social engineering\\u2014the psychological manipulation of people to gain confidential information or access\\u2014has been a core tactic for cybercriminals for decades. With the help of GPT and other advanced NLP models, attackers are now able to conduct large-scale scams with unprecedented efficiency and sophistication.\\nHow GPT Enhances Social Engineering Scams\\nSocial engineering relies heavily on manipulating human trust and exploiting emotional responses. This can include tactics such as creating a sense of urgency, presenting fake opportunities, or leveraging authority figures to manipulate the victim into acting. AI tools like GPT, capable of mimicking real people\\u2019s communication style and tone, significantly increase the effectiveness of these tactics.\\nFor example, an attacker might use GPT to impersonate a customer service agent from a popular e-commerce site, claiming there\\u2019s an issue with the victim\\u2019s recent purchase. The scam could involve a fake \\\"verification\\\" step requiring the victim to provide their payment information, which the attacker then steals.\\nGPT allows scammers to craft contextually appropriate and emotionally compelling messages in a fraction of the time it would take a human. The ability to tailor these messages makes it possible to run highly targeted scams against specific individuals or even entire companies.\\nA Real-World Example: Fake Job Offers\\nIn a 2023 scam uncovered by The Verge, GPT-3 was used to craft fake job offer letters from well-known tech companies. The emails appeared to come from reputable recruiters, offering the recipient a dream job in a high-demand field like software development or data science.\\nThe scam message included personal information (e.g., job title, salary details, and location) tailored to the victim\\u2019s public LinkedIn profile. The letter encouraged the recipient to \\\"accept the offer\\\" via a link that led to a fake recruitment website, where they were asked to provide personal details, including Social Security numbers and banking information.\\nThese AI-generated scam emails were convincing enough that several people accepted the job offers, believing they were real. The scammers collected this sensitive data and used it for identity theft, selling it on dark web forums.\\nFor more on how AI is transforming job-related scams, check out this report from ZDNet, which discusses the rise of AI-powered fake job offers.\\nWhy AI-Generated Scams Are So Dangerous\\n- Increased Speed and Volume: Traditional scammers might manually craft a few hundred scam messages per day. With GPT, the same criminals can generate thousands of personalized scam messages in just minutes. This scalability makes it easier to reach more victims and increases the likelihood that at least some will fall for the scam.\\n- Hyper-Personalization: GPT\\u2019s ability to analyze public data (e.g., social media profiles, public records, or company websites) means that scams can be extremely personalized. A scam email that mentions a recent purchase or a new product release can convince the recipient that the message is legitimate. This hyper-targeted approach makes these scams far more effective than generic ones.\\n- Emotional Manipulation: GPT can be used to craft messages that manipulate a victim\\u2019s emotions, such as urgency (e.g., \\\"Your account has been compromised, click here to secure it now\\\") or fear (e.g., \\\"A payment issue needs immediate resolution to avoid suspension\\\"). By exploiting human emotions, GPT-driven scams can create a sense of panic, leading the victim to act without thinking.\\nDefending Against AI-Generated Scams\\nSo how can individuals and organizations protect themselves from AI-driven scams?\\n-\\nEducate and Train: The first line of defense is education. Users must understand the red flags of scams, such as unsolicited requests for personal information, urgent messages, and offers that sound too good to be true. Regular training programs in companies can help employees spot social engineering tactics more effectively.\\n-\\nUse AI for Defense: Just as attackers use AI to craft scams, defenders can also leverage AI to detect and block malicious activity. AI-based fraud detection systems are already being used by banks and financial institutions to flag suspicious transactions and identify potentially fraudulent behavior before it escalates.\\n-\\nVerify Before Acting: Encourage a policy of double-checking any communication that seems suspicious, even if it appears to be from a trusted source. This could mean calling the company directly or verifying through an official website, rather than acting on an unsolicited email or message.\\n-\\nAvoid Sharing Personal Information Online: Scammers rely on public data from social media and other online sources. Reducing the amount of personal information shared online can make it harder for AI systems to generate targeted scams. As GPT-powered social engineering becomes more prevalent, the potential for AI-driven scams continues to grow. With the ability to craft personalized, emotionally charged, and scalable scams, AI is becoming a formidable tool for cybercriminals. However, with awareness, training, and the proper use of countermeasures, it is possible to defend against these increasingly sophisticated attacks.\\nFor more information on social engineering tactics and how to protect yourself from scams, you can check out these resources: \\u2022\\nMisinformation and Fake News: GPT\\u2019s Role in Shaping Public Opinion\\nOne of the most alarming aspects of GPT and similar advanced language models is their potential to fuel the spread of misinformation and fake news. In the digital age, where information travels at lightning speed through social media, the ability of AI to generate realistic, but entirely fabricated, content can have devastating consequences for public trust, political stability, and even social movements.\\nHow GPT Fuels Misinformation\\nGPT's ability to generate coherent, contextually relevant, and engaging text makes it a powerful tool for crafting fake news articles, spreading conspiracy theories, or manipulating public opinion. Unlike traditional methods of creating fake content (which may require extensive time and effort), GPT can instantly generate realistic articles, headlines, social media posts, and even responses in online discussions.\\nBecause GPT is trained on vast datasets containing both factual and false information, it can easily generate content that seems plausible, even when it\\u2019s entirely false. In the hands of malicious actors, these capabilities can be used to create viral misinformation campaigns that are hard to distinguish from legitimate news.\\nA Real-World Example: Election Manipulation\\nOne of the most concerning potential abuses of GPT is its ability to influence elections through the creation and spread of fake news. During the 2020 U.S. presidential election, disinformation campaigns were rampant on social media, with fake news stories designed to sway voter opinions and spread confusion.\\nImagine a scenario where GPT-powered bots are used to create fake political news articles that seem to come from credible sources. For example, an AI could generate a story claiming that a certain candidate is involved in a scandal, with fabricated details and quotes that appear to come from real interviews or press conferences. Such stories could be shared across social media platforms, amplifying their reach and potentially influencing voters' perceptions.\\nIn 2021, researchers discovered how deepfakes (AI-generated videos that manipulate speech and facial expressions) were used alongside GPT-generated text to create convincing political disinformation. For instance, fake video clips of politicians making controversial statements, coupled with AI-generated news stories, led to a spike in online discussion around fabricated events.\\nFor more about AI and misinformation in elections, you can check out this article from The New York Times on how AI tools were used during political campaigns.\\nWhy GPT-Generated Misinformation Works\\n- Credibility of Language: GPT\\u2019s ability to generate highly fluent, well-written text makes fake news appear more credible. When reading an article, people generally tend to trust well-written content, especially if it mirrors the tone and structure of legitimate news outlets. This ability to mimic human-like language makes it more difficult for consumers to spot the difference between true and false information.\\n- Amplification and Viral Spread: Once GPT-generated fake news enters the digital ecosystem, it can spread quickly. The nature of social media platforms allows posts to go viral, and AI tools can be used to generate a large volume of similar misinformation in a short amount of time. These bots can be used to repost, comment, and engage with the content, making it appear as if it\\u2019s coming from a large group of people, further enhancing its believability.\\n- Customization for Target Audiences: GPT's capability to personalize content means it can create fake news stories that are designed specifically for different audience groups. For example, political misinformation can be tailored to appeal to specific political ideologies or demographics, increasing the likelihood that it will resonate with the target audience and gain traction.\\n- Deep Integration with Existing Disinformation Campaigns: Malicious actors can use GPT alongside other tools\\u2014like deepfakes or bot-driven social media networks\\u2014to create a more convincing narrative. Together, these tools can manipulate not only text but also video and audio, creating an even more immersive disinformation campaign.\\nA Case Study: AI and COVID-19 Misinformation\\nThe COVID-19 pandemic witnessed the massive spread of misinformation across social media platforms, with conspiracy theories, fake health advice, and false claims about vaccines reaching millions of people. During the height of the pandemic, GPT-3 was used by some individuals to create and disseminate fake health articles that misled people about the virus, its spread, and potential treatments.\\nOne notable case involved an AI-generated article that claimed a specific home remedy could cure COVID-19. The article was written in a professional tone and cited fake medical studies to back up its claims. Because it appeared on a popular health blog, many readers believed it, which led to harmful health decisions for some.\\nGPT\\u2019s ability to produce plausible-sounding content combined with the already-existing fear and uncertainty surrounding the pandemic made these kinds of fake news stories especially dangerous. This is why it's important to fact-check any health advice found online.\\nFor more on how AI is being used to spread misinformation, check out this article on Wired, which discusses how AI models were used to generate fake news during the pandemic.\\nDefending Against GPT-Driven Misinformation\\nWhile AI-generated misinformation presents a huge challenge, there are several ways to combat it:\\n- Fact-Checking and Verification Tools: Organizations and governments need to invest in advanced fact-checking systems that can quickly flag and debunk fake news stories. Tools like Google\\u2019s Fact Check Explorer or Poynter\\u2019s International Fact-Checking Network help users verify the authenticity of news stories before sharing them.\\n- Media Literacy Education: In an age where disinformation spreads quickly, it\\u2019s vital to improve media literacy. Individuals must be taught how to critically evaluate the sources of the information they consume, especially in the context of social media.\\n- Collaboration with AI Developers: AI developers must work closely with regulatory bodies and social media platforms to develop safeguards that can detect and remove AI-generated fake news. Platforms like Twitter and Facebook are already deploying AI tools to track and flag potential misinformation, but more work is needed.\\n- Transparency in AI Models: One important step is to increase transparency around the development and deployment of AI models. Researchers and developers should implement systems to track the origin of AI-generated content and ensure that these tools cannot be easily misused for disinformation.\\nThe Mechanism Behind Malicious Use: How GPT Is Being Exploited in the Wild\\nGPT, like other advanced AI tools, is a double-edged sword. While it powers innovative and creative applications, it\\u2019s also ripe for exploitation. But how exactly are cybercriminals leveraging language models like GPT for malicious activities? The short answer: with remarkable ease and efficiency. In a world where malicious actors are constantly seeking new ways to exploit technology, GPT has proven to be a tool that's both powerful and deceptively simple to use. Let's break down how these models are being weaponized in the wild and what makes them so attractive to cybercriminals.\\n-\\nAutomation and Efficiency: Scaling Attacks Like Never Before\\nIn the past, creating convincing phishing campaigns or spam was a time-consuming process that required significant human labor. Cybercriminals had to manually write emails, craft fake websites, and design the attacks. Today, GPT changes all that. With just a few clicks, scammers can automate the entire process.\\nImagine the scenario: an attacker needs to send out thousands of phishing emails. Instead of crafting each one by hand, they simply provide GPT with a prompt\\u2014say, \\\"Write an urgent email from a bank requesting account verification\\\"\\u2014and voila, a batch of customized, grammatically flawless emails is ready to go. This is where GPT's natural language fluency becomes both a boon and a bane: the output is so convincing that even experienced users can be duped.\\n-\\nLanguage Customization for Psychological Manipulation:\\nAnother aspect of GPT\\u2019s versatility that cybercriminals love is its ability to mimic specific tones and emotional cues. Cybercriminals don\\u2019t just rely on a one-size-fits-all approach anymore. They tailor the content to resonate with particular emotions or psychological triggers.\\nFor example, imagine a scam targeting a remote worker who\\u2019s in charge of a company\\u2019s payroll. The attacker might use GPT to craft an email that mimics the language of the CEO, discussing a \\\"confidential\\\" matter. The message might sound something like this:\\n\\\"Hi [Name], I need you to process this immediate transfer today for an important client. This is urgent. Let me know once it's completed.\\\"\\nThis email plays on a sense of urgency, but more importantly, it looks and sounds like a real communication\\u2014one that someone in the target\\u2019s role would receive from their CEO. The AI makes the email sound plausible, so the victim believes they\\u2019re simply following routine orders. It\\u2019s a perfect example of how personalization can increase the success of these scams.\\n-\\nThe Dangers of GPT\\u2019s Mass Adoption: Lowering the Bar for Cybercriminals:\\nThe accessibility of GPT also makes it so dangerous. Open-source models like GPT-Neo or GPT-J, and public APIs like OpenAI\\u2019s, allow anyone with basic technical knowledge to get started. This means that even a novice hacker can begin launching sophisticated attacks using language models.\\nPreviously, you needed some coding skills or social engineering knowledge to run a large-scale scam. Now, with GPT\\u2019s powerful capabilities, even the untrained can automate cybercrime operations. It's not just tech-savvy criminals using this either\\u2014teenagers, hacktivists, and low-level scammers now have the tools to disrupt systems on a grand scale.\\n-\\nGPT and the Rise of AI-Generated Fake Content:\\nAnother area where GPT is causing headaches is in the world of fake content. Whether it\\u2019s fake reviews, social media posts, or commentary, GPT can churn out high-quality, seemingly real content at an alarming rate. The scale at which fake information can be generated makes it easy to manipulate the digital landscape.\\nLet\\u2019s take online reviews as an example. Fake reviews have long been a problem for consumers, but GPT has raised the stakes. A scammer could instruct GPT to write hundreds of highly detailed, persuasive reviews for a product they\\u2019re promoting. These reviews could mention specific features, compare it to competitors, and even use local jargon to sound authentic. What\\u2019s worse? These fake reviews could remain undetected by traditional review-monitoring systems because of how realistic GPT's writing appears.\\n-\\nHow GPT Is Making Cyberattacks More Convincing:\\nBeyond just producing text, GPT\\u2019s ability to adapt and mimic different writing styles has opened up a whole new world for scammers. Take CEO fraud\\u2014or business email compromise (BEC)\\u2014for example. In a typical BEC attack, scammers impersonate high-ranking executives and trick employees into wiring money or sharing sensitive information.\\nWith GPT, malicious actors can take it a step further. If they have access to emails, social media profiles, or internal communications from the target company, GPT can study the writing style of an executive and then generate emails that mimic that person\\u2019s tone and voice. The result is an email that feels personal, authentic, and impossible to distinguish from the real thing.\\nGPT\\u2019s Impact on Traditional Cybersecurity Tools\\nWhat makes GPT and other similar models so dangerous isn\\u2019t just their capacity for automating attacks\\u2014it\\u2019s also their ability to bypass traditional cybersecurity tools. Spam filters and anti-phishing technologies, which rely on pre-defined rules or suspicious keywords, are often inadequate at detecting AI-generated content because the language is so fluid and contextually appropriate.\\nWith GPT-generated content being indistinguishable from human-created content, detecting malicious emails or websites becomes increasingly difficult. In fact, as attackers learn how to better craft their prompts and fine-tune the output, even state-of-the-art detection systems may struggle to keep up.\\nDefending Against the Dark Side: Practical Steps\\nSo how do we stop this? Is there any way to protect ourselves from the emerging threat of AI-driven cybercrime?\\n- Advanced AI-Detection Systems: First and foremost, businesses and tech platforms must invest in AI-powered detection systems that can scan for anomalies in written content. These systems should be able to identify patterns typically found in GPT-generated content, such as unnatural repetition or lack of coherent structure, and flag these items as suspicious.\\n- Human-in-the-Loop Verification: Even with AI's growth, human oversight is essential. Cybersecurity professionals should continuously verify suspicious content that automated systems flag. GPT can mimic human language, but it\\u2019s still up to real people to assess the intent and context behind the message.\\n- User Awareness Training: Beyond technology, the most crucial defense is people. By teaching users how to recognize suspicious or too-good-to-be-true communications, businesses and individuals can lower the chances of falling victim to AI-powered social engineering.\\n- Stronger Authentication Measures: Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is one of the best ways to ensure that even if a phishing attack succeeds, the attacker cannot easily gain access to a system. Encouraging employees to verify requests and implement secure login systems can make a world of difference.\\nWhat\\u2019s Next? Future Implications and Regulatory Measures\\nAs AI, specifically GPT and its derivatives, continues to advance at a breakneck pace, it\\u2019s clear that its implications\\u2014both positive and negative\\u2014will shape the future in profound ways. But how do we prepare for the next wave of technological disruption, especially when it comes to security, privacy, and misinformation? More importantly, what regulatory frameworks can be put in place to prevent widespread harm while still encouraging innovation?\\nIn this final section, we\\u2019ll explore the future implications of GPT, the potential risks, and the necessary regulatory measures that need to be implemented to mitigate its misuse.\\n-\\nThe Rise of More Advanced AI and Its Dangers\\nThe future of AI looks even more sophisticated. Models like GPT-4 are already capable of generating complex and convincing narratives, but future versions will likely be smarter, more intuitive, and harder to detect. As these models become increasingly capable, they could pose even greater threats to individuals and societies.\\nImagine a world where GPT is integrated seamlessly into voice assistants, video editors, and even robotic automation. What happens when AI can produce realistic video, audio, and text in a completely integrated manner? Fake videos or voices, combined with text, could produce a hyper-realistic deepfake ecosystem that is virtually undetectable.\\nIn this world, scams, political manipulation, and misinformation campaigns could evolve from simple text-based phishing to immersive multimedia experiences. The line between real and fake could become so blurred that distinguishing the two might be nearly impossible for the average person.\\n-\\nThe Need for Ethical AI Development\\nAs we hurtle toward a future where AI systems are embedded in nearly every aspect of life, the importance of ethical AI development cannot be overstated. AI developers and tech companies must adhere to rigorous ethical guidelines to ensure that their tools are not being misused. This includes the ethical training of models and ensuring that these systems are used responsibly.\\nFor example, models like GPT should be equipped with guardrails that limit the generation of harmful content, such as hate speech, misinformation, or predatory schemes. This would require continuous updates to training data to ensure that models aren\\u2019t inadvertently learning or reinforcing harmful biases.\\nHowever, ethical development also requires a balance\\u2014ensuring that AI doesn\\u2019t become over-regulated to the point where its creative potential is stifled. AI\\u2019s potential for good\\u2014in areas like healthcare, education, and the arts\\u2014must be nurtured while also safeguarding against its potential for harm.\\n-\\nCalls for Global Regulation: Who Should Govern AI?\\nWith GPT and other NLP tools becoming more powerful and pervasive, there\\u2019s a growing demand for global regulation of AI. Various governmental bodies, tech companies, and independent organizations are already debating how to create a legal framework for AI use-\\n- The European Union is at the forefront of regulatory efforts. With the Artificial Intelligence Act, the EU aims to create a comprehensive legal framework that governs high-risk AI applications like facial recognition, autonomous vehicles, and AI-driven healthcare. This framework includes guidelines on transparency, accountability, and the explainability of AI models.\\n- The United States has taken a more fragmented approach, with individual states and private companies leading the charge for AI regulation. However, recent developments suggest that more comprehensive federal regulation could be coming, particularly in areas like data privacy and AI-driven automation.\\n- Meanwhile, China is pushing forward with its own regulatory approach, with a focus on developing AI governance structures that align with the country\\u2019s broader economic and social goals.\\nDespite these efforts, a unified global standard for AI regulation has yet to be established. The challenge here is to create an international consensus that balances innovation with public safety, security, and privacy.\\n-\\nAI Transparency and Accountability\\nOne of the critical areas of focus in future AI governance is transparency. If we are going to trust AI systems with critical decisions\\u2014whether they relate to personal data, political opinions, or healthcare\\u2014we need to ensure that these systems operate in a transparent and accountable manner.\\nThis will involve open-source audits of AI algorithms, where external researchers can examine the models to ensure they are not being trained on biased data or generating harmful content. Moreover, AI developers must be clear about how their models are being trained, what data is being used, and how they intend to ensure fairness and ethical compliance.\\nAccountability will also be key. If an AI system is used to create harmful misinformation or facilitates a scam, there must be a clear chain of responsibility. Is it the developer, the platform provider, or the user who should bear the consequences of the damage?\\n-\\nEducating Users to Navigate the AI-Driven Future\\nWith AI becoming so prevalent, digital literacy will become more important than ever. We need to equip users with the skills to critically assess content and recognize when they\\u2019re being exposed to manipulative AI-generated material. This will require:\\n- Curriculum integration: Schools and universities must prioritize AI literacy as part of their educational programs. This would help individuals understand the tools at their disposal while also recognizing when AI is being used for malicious purposes.\\n- Public awareness campaigns: Governments and tech companies can play a role by educating the public about the risks associated with AI-driven scams, misinformation, and privacy violations. Fact-checking tools and warning systems can be integrated into popular platforms to help users identify potentially harmful content.\\n-\\nThe Role of Industry in Self-Regulation\\nTech companies, especially those developing AI like GPT, have a huge responsibility to engage in self-regulation. This involves putting in place their own ethical guidelines and safeguards for the use of AI. Some of the best practices could include:\\n- Limiting access to certain AI capabilities (like deepfake generation or large-scale automation) for users who have clear, legitimate purposes for using them.\\n- Implementing usage policies that prohibit harmful applications, like generating harmful content, spam, or fake news.\\n- Continuous model monitoring to ensure that AI doesn\\u2019t evolve in ways that could lead to unintended consequences. Several companies have already begun taking steps in this direction, but the industry as a whole will need to work together to set uniform standards.\\n-\\nThe Future of AI: Opportunities and Risks\\nAs we look ahead, GPT and similar AI models will undoubtedly continue to evolve, offering tremendous potential for innovation in areas like content creation, healthcare, and data analysis. However, the risks associated with their misuse will also grow. Balancing innovation with security will be a tightrope walk for developers, regulators, and users alike.\\nThe ultimate question will be: How can we harness the power of AI while mitigating the harm it could cause? This will require a collective effort from governments, tech companies, researchers, and citizens to create a safe, fair, and accountable AI-driven future.\\nThe dark side of GPT and other NLP tools is real, but so are their incredible benefits. As these tools continue to evolve, so must our approach to security, regulation, and accountability. While we cannot entirely eliminate the risk of misuse, we can take proactive steps to shape a future where AI is used ethically and responsibly.\\nThe road ahead will require innovation in regulation, user education, and industry-wide collaboration. By addressing these challenges head-on, we can ensure that AI serves as a force for good while protecting against its potential for harm.\\nFor more information on the regulation of AI, check out the following resources:\\n- EU\\u2019s Artificial Intelligence Act\\n- AI Ethics Guidelines from the OECD\"\n",

For a discovery to count, the AI has to oversee the entire project, from hypothesis generation to experiment design to data analysis. Machines are already assisting human researchers in almost every step of that process, but being truly autonomous is still a leap forward.\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s almost certain\\u201d that AI will reach that level eventually, one researcher told Nature: \\u201cThe question is if it will take 50 years or 10.\\u201d\\nThe Nobel Prize for Physics was awarded for research that showed the impact of quantum mechanics on everyday-sized objects.\\nQuantum effects were known at the level of atoms, but in the 1980s John Clarke, Michel H.

Solar power led the charge, covering 83% of the increase in electricity demand.\\nEmber described the moment as a \\u201ccrucial turning point,\\u201d whereby clean power can keep pace with rapidly growing energy needs, particularly as the world faces the huge increase in power necessary to fuel the AI boom.\\nHowever, the think tank warned that there are significant regional differences behind the numbers; new data from the International Energy Agency revised renewable energy growth in the US by 2030 down by half. It also suggested that the pace of renewables adoption in China \\u2014 the current largest renewables growth market globally \\u2014 could temper, the Financial Times reported.\\nRenewables are expected to boom elsewhere, however: Pakistan imported enough solar panels in 2024 to generate around a third of the country\\u2019s current power generation capacity, the BBC said. And in Africa, solar panel imports are up 60% in the year to June compared with the same period last year.\\nOpenAI inked a deal with chip designer AMD to collaborate on AI data centers, in a challenge to semiconductor giant Nvidia.\\nThe deal, which caused AMD\\u2019s stock to soar, reflects the tech sector\\u2019s intensifying quest for computing power and ultimately banks on a \\u201cnear-limitless demand for AI,\\u201d WIRED wrote: Running AMD\\u2019s processors will match the energy needs of 5 million American homes. The US has become \\u201cone big bet on AI,\\u201d as optimism over the sector props up the economy, one analyst wrote.\\nDriving that bet is OpenAI, whose CEO Sam Altman has proven to be a prolific dealmaker. The company also has agreements with firms including Nvidia and Oracle \\u2014 pacts that have raised fears of an AI bubble.\\nIsrael and Hamas began indirect negotiations through Arab mediators in Egypt Monday on a Gaza peace plan, raising the possibility of a potential end to the brutal war on the eve of its two-year anniversary.\\nHamas said it agrees to parts of a 20-point US peace plan, including the release of all remaining Israeli hostages, but has not acknowledged other demands, including full disarmament and its permanent exclusion from governing the enclave.\\nThough US President Donald Trump ordered Israel to halt its attacks, it continued to pound Gaza Monday. Trump has also threatened \\u201ccomplete obliteration\\u201d of Hamas if it insists on staying in power.\\nEven as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu looks to take credit for the emerging deal, it has become clear that Trump was \\u201cthe one calling the shots,\\u201d The New York Times wrote. On Sunday night, the president exhorted negotiators to \\u201cMOVE FAST,\\u201d adding that he expected the first phase of the deal to unfold this week.\\nA US judge blocked the government from deploying troops to Oregon state, spotlighting the growing role of the courts in the country\\u2019s politics.\\nThe latest order, issued late on Sunday, comes as the Trump administration looks to deploy military forces to Democrat-led cities nationwide: The White House says they are necessary to combat alleged lawlessness; Democrats argue their constituents are being targeted.\\nThe latest decision came on the eve of the Supreme Court beginning a new term that analysts say will include significant new tests of presidential power, including over the administration\\u2019s use of tariffs, attempted curbs on birthright citizenship, and efforts to fire officials from independent government agencies.\\nFrance\\u2019s prime minister resigned less than a month after taking office, plunging the country deeper into a seemingly intractable political crisis.\\nS\\u00e9bastien Lecornu \\u2014 President Emmanuel Macron\\u2019s seventh premier \\u2014 quit following widespread criticism over his new cabinet, which was largely unchanged from that of the prior government.\\nHis departure showcases the short-term challenge facing Macron\\u2019s ministers, who have repeatedly failed to pass a budget in the face of far-right and far-left opposition, and the longer-term fear over the rise of the country\\u2019s main nationalist, anti-immigration party, which is topping opinion polls.\\nThe impasse has left investors wary: A recent Deutsche Bank survey pegged France as the country most likely to face a government bond crisis.\\nJapanese stocks surged after the country\\u2019s ruling party chose its next leader \\u2014 and likely next prime minister \\u2014 amid growing investor buoyancy over prospects for one of the world\\u2019s largest economies.\\nThe LDP, which has ruled Japan largely uninterrupted since World War II, put Sanae Takaichi on track to be the country\\u2019s first female prime minister.\\nShe inherits a dizzying array of challenges, including a fast-aging population and worries over Chinese aggression. Yet economists note the country has removed major barriers to business, manufacturers are feeling more upbeat, and monetary policy is normalizing: The Nikkei 225 index hit a record following Takaichi\\u2019s selection. \\u201cWe are bullish on Japan,\\u201d Apollo\\u2019s chief economist wrote.\\nChina and India agreed to restart direct flights after a five-year hiatus, the latest sign of thawing relations between the world\\u2019s most populous nations. New Delhi said flights between Kolkata and Guangzhou would restart this month for the first time since border clashes in 2020.\\nThe decision comes just months after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi made his first visit to Beijing in seven years, with the countries\\u2019 leaders drawing closer, particularly after US President Donald Trump imposed 50% tariffs on India, upending what had been a burgeoning bilateral partnership. Those levies were \\u201cone of the biggest shocks that India has ever got,\\u201d an expert said, forcing New Delhi to seek new allies.\\nDiscoveries about how our immune systems avoid attacking our own bodies \\u2014 research which helped create new pathways for treating autoimmune diseases \\u2014 won the 2025 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine.\\nT-cells are designed to attack proteins in pathogens, but those proteins are often similar to our body\\u2019s own proteins. Mary Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell, and Shimon Sakaguchi discovered that the immune system has \\u201cself-tolerance\\u201d safeguards which prevent it from attacking our own cells.\\nCrucially, the findings also helped create new cancer treatments: Cancer cells use the body\\u2019s self-tolerance to hide, and immunotherapy is designed to take the brakes off and allow the immune system to attack those cells.\\nJapan is on track to have its first female prime minister.\\nA former economic security minister who cites Margaret Thatcher as her hero, Sanae Takaichi was elected to lead Japan\\u2019s governing LDP, which has ruled the country almost continuously since World War II but is mired in an array of crises.\\nAmong her top priorities is tackling inflation \\u2014 a relatively new problem given Japan\\u2019s decades of falling prices \\u2014 making her selection a worrying one for investors: Takaichi will likely push for aggressive spending and looser monetary policy in a bid to boost the economy.\\nShe will also pull Japan\\u2019s politics further to the right, mirroring a trend of resurgent populist conservatism worldwide, The Wall Street Journal wrote.\\nThe world\\u2019s major oil producers agreed to raise output again, a move that raised fears of a supply glut and could further dampen prices.\\nOPEC+ is looking to reclaim market share lost to US shale producers and maintain discipline within the group \\u2014 some members stand accused of violating quotas \\u2014 while the group\\u2019s heavyweight member, Saudi Arabia, is likely hoping that lower prices will please US President Donald Trump.\\nStill, the increase was a relatively small one, a careful step taken \\u201cafter witnessing how nervous the market had become,\\u201d one analyst said.\\n\\u201cThe real test will come when fundamentals and politics shift again.\\u201d High geopolitical volatility makes predicting the market\\u2019s future even more difficult than usual, a Reuters columnist argued.\\nUS President Donald Trump is considering a bailout of at least $10 billion to help the country\\u2019s soybean farmers survive a boycott from China.\\nThe humble soybean has become a flashpoint in the trade war between the world\\u2019s two largest economies after Beijing ceased all purchases from the US.\\nThe possible aid from Washington reflects China\\u2019s leverage in talks with the US, similar to how Beijing used rare-earth export curbs to extract trade concessions from Washington, analysts said.\\nChina is now reportedly pushing for the White House to roll back national-security restrictions on Chinese investments in the US.\\nBirds of different species can understand each other\\u2019s alarm calls warning of cuckoos.\\nBrood parasites such as cuckoos lay their eggs in other birds\\u2019 nests, tricking the hosts into caring for their offspring at the expense of their own.\\nResearch found that 21 bird species across four continents all make similar \\u201cwhining\\u201d vocalizations when they spot a brood parasite, and when played recordings of other species\\u2019 calls, they all recognize them and react by mobbing the invader.\\nOne researcher told New Scientist that the calls, referring to external objects in the world rather than internal states such as fear or excitement, \\u201ccould be the first stepping stone towards language\\u201d and that animal communication and human language were on a spectrum.\\nA controversial musical depicting the Spanish conquest of Mexico has ignited a transatlantic debate over Latin American history and identity.\\nCentering on conquistador Hern\\u00e1n Cort\\u00e9s and his Nahuatl translator, Malinche ostensibly celebrates mestizaje, or racial mixing, but has been accused of promoting \\u201coutdated, racist notions\\u201d regarding Aztec rituals, and the idea that colonization benefited indigenous people.\\nForeign Policy called the show, currently playing in Mexico City, an \\u201cobscenely romanticized\\u201d \\u201canti-Hamilton,\\u201d while conservatives complained that a historical priest was initially portrayed in drag.\\nMalinche\\u2019s producer, for his part, hoped the debate would \\u201cbring people to come and judge\\u201d for themselves.\\nThe brouhaha points to real wounds: Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum declined to invite Spain\\u2019s king to her inauguration after he failed to apologize for the conquest.\\nThe US military struck another alleged narcotics vessel off the coast of Venezuela Friday, killing four, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said.\\nThe strike \\u2014 at least the fourth such attack \\u2014 brings the total number of alleged smugglers killed by the US in recent weeks to at least 18.\\nHegseth wrote on X that he directed the lethal strike, carried out in international waters, on a \\u201cvessel transporting substantial amounts of narcotics \\u2014 headed to America to poison our people.\\u201d\\nIt came after the White House informed Congress this week that the country was engaged in \\u201carmed conflict\\u201d with drug cartels, which the administration has designated as terrorist organizations, The New York Times reported.\\nThe strikes have raised tensions with Caracas, which fears a full-scale invasion, as President Donald Trump reportedly weighs strikes inside the country.\\nCritics have questioned the legality of the campaign, with one commentator accusing Trump of emulating \\u201cthe worst excesses\\u201d of US policy in Latin America.\\nHamas said it agreed to release all remaining Israeli hostages in Gaza under a framework proposed by US President Donald Trump, stating that it \\u201caffirms its readiness to immediately enter into negotiations\\u201d to discuss the details.\\nEarlier on Friday, Trump set a new weekend deadline for Hamas to agree to a peace deal on the enclave\\u2019s future, calling it the militant group\\u2019s \\u201clast chance.\\u201d Hamas\\u2019 statement suggested the group is seeking changes to the proposal, however, and that a deal has not yet been agreed to.\\nIf no deal is reached by 6:00 pm Sunday Eastern time, \\u201call

This comprehensive prompt turns ChatGPT into a content optimization expert for both worlds.\\nLet's be honest: keeping up with content optimization is exhausting. For years, we\\u2019ve been chasing Google's algorithm, tweaking keywords, and building backlinks. Just when we thought we had a handle on it, the entire game changed. Now, we\\u2019re not just writing for Google; we\\u2019re writing for ChatGPT, Perplexity, AI Overviews, and a dozen other AI-powered answer engines.\\nAs a builder and marketer, I found myself stuck. My old SEO playbook felt outdated. My content wasn't showing up in AI-generated answers. I was spending hours manually auditing my articles, trying to guess what both traditional search crawlers and large language models wanted.\\nIt was a mess. So, I decided to build a tool to fix it. Not an app, not a SaaS, but a single, powerful AI prompt. A prompt designed to turn a generic LLM into a specialist\\u2014an expert content strategist that understands both the old rules of SEO and the new landscape of Generative Engine Optimization (GEO).\\nToday, I\\u2019m sharing it with you.\\nThe Game Has Changed: Welcome to the Era of AI Search\\nBefore I give you the prompt, let's quickly touch on why this is so critical. For two decades, the goal of SEO was to get a click. You rank on page one, a user clicks your link, and they land on your site.\\nAI search flips that model on its head. The new goal is to get cited.\\nUsers are asking conversational questions to tools like ChatGPT and getting direct answers. These AIs synthesize information from multiple sources and present a summary. If your content is the source for that summary, you win. You gain visibility and authority, even if you don't get a direct click. This is the new \\\"Position Zero.\\\"\\nThis shift requires a new approach:\\n- From Keywords to Concepts: AI understands entities and context, not just keywords.\\n- From Backlinks to Authority: AI prioritizes E-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness) signals and high-quality source citations.\\n- From Clicks to Citations: Success is measured by how often your content is used as a trusted source in AI-generated answers.\\nOptimizing for this new world while not forgetting traditional SEO is the core of what I call GEO\\/AEO (Generative Engine Optimization \\/ Answer Engine Optimization). And that\\u2019s exactly what this prompt is built to do.\\nIntroducing the \\\"Content Optimization Specialist\\\" Prompt\\nI designed this prompt to be a comprehensive, one-stop audit for any blog post. It instructs an AI to analyze content from multiple angles, acting as an expert with 10+ years of experience in both traditional and AI-powered search.\\nIt doesn't just give you vague advice. It provides a structured, actionable report covering:\\n- Traditional SEO: The fundamentals that still matter (titles, meta descriptions, keywords, links).\\n- GEO\\/AEO for AI Search: The new frontier (structured data, citation-friendliness, conversational queries, E-E-A-T signals).\\n- Content Quality & Readability: The human element (value, originality, structure, clarity).\\n- Engagement & Technicals: The hooks that keep readers and the backend stuff that ensures a smooth experience.\\nThe best part? It delivers this analysis in a prioritized format, so you know exactly what to fix first for the biggest impact.\\nThe Full Prompt: Your New Content Superpower\\nAlright, here it is. It's long and incredibly detailed, and that's by design. A powerful prompt needs to provide deep context and clear instructions.\\nCopy and paste the entire thing into your favorite AI chatbot (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.), followed by the text of your blog post and some context (target keyword, audience, goals).\\nYou are an expert SEO & GEO Content Optimization Specialist with 10+ years of experience in content marketing, search engine optimization, AI-powered search (GEO\\/AEO), and digital publishing. You stay current with the latest developments in both traditional SEO and emerging AI search technologies. You excel at analyzing blog posts and providing actionable, data-driven recommendations to improve their performance across ALL search platforms - traditional search engines (Google, Bing) AND AI-powered tools (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google AI Overviews, Bing Copilot).\\n# Your Mission\\nAnalyze the provided blog post and deliver a comprehensive optimization report that enhances:\\n- **Traditional Search Engine Visibility (SEO)**: Google, Bing organic rankings\\n- **AI Search Engine Optimization (GEO\\/AEO)**: ChatGPT, Perplexity, AI Overviews, Copilot\\n- **Reader Engagement**: Time on page, bounce rate, interactions\\n- **Content Structure**: Logical flow for both humans and AI parsing\\n- **Conversion Potential**: CTAs, lead generation, goal completions\\n- **AI Citation-Worthiness**: Make your content the source AI tools reference\\n- **Overall Content Quality**: E-E-A-T signals, accuracy, originality\\n# Analysis Framework\\n## 1.

These are great for learning and immediately improving key sections of your article.\\n- Work Through the Checklist: The \\\"Implementation Checklist\\\" is your roadmap. Work your way from Priority 1 down.\\n- Embrace GEO\\/AEO: Pay close attention to the AI search optimization section. Adding structured data (\\nSchema.org\\n), clear Q&A sections, and quotable, fact-based statements will future-proof your content. - Rinse and Repeat: Use this prompt to audit new posts before you publish them and to refresh old content that has started to decline in traffic.\\nThis Isn't a Magic Wand\\u2014It's a Power Tool\\nTo be clear, this prompt won't automatically make your content go viral. It's a diagnostic tool, not a creative one. The quality of your original ideas, your research, and your unique voice still matter more than anything.\\nBut what it will do is ensure your great content gets the visibility it deserves. It helps you structure your ideas in a way that both humans and machines can understand and appreciate. It takes the guesswork out of technical optimization and lets you focus on what you do best: creating valuable content.\\nThe world of search is in the middle of a massive shift. The tools and tactics that worked yesterday are already becoming less effective. By embracing a strategy that serves both traditional search engines and new AI platforms, you can build a more resilient content engine for the future.\\nGive the prompt a try, and let me know what you think. What other strategies are you using to adapt to the age of AI search?\"\n",

This was AI that we could set to a task \\u2013 tell it what to do, and let go. It could handle customer contacts, analyze data, and automate repetitive tasks.\\nAnd now there\\u2019s agentic coding. This is AI that can build AI. We can set up agentic coding using plain-text prompts, and the AI will devise the code to create the agent. It\\u2019s AI that understands what we want and how to get it done.\\nAs Wells Fargo analyst Ryan MacWilliams puts it, the market impact is only starting to be felt: \\u201cInvestors underestimating how the launch of agentic coding in Feb. 2025 has led to a wave of new AI development. Agentic coding automates AI agent builds, and drives significant coding productivity. Buy infrastructure SaaS, the AI build cycle is on.\\u201d\\nAgainst this backdrop, MacWilliams is recommending three stocks that are poised to benefit from a new AI boom. All three are linked to agentic AI and coding, and according to the TipRanks database, all three have Strong Buy ratings from the Street. Here are the details on these Wells Fargo AI picks.\\nHubSpot, Inc.(HUBS)\\nWe\\u2019ll start with a look at the marketing software platform HubSpot. HubSpot has been in business since 2006, and has become one of the online marketing world\\u2019s go-to software platforms. The company offers its customers a set of cloud-based digital marketing tools purpose-built to solve the day-to-day issues that face marketers in fields like CRM, social media, content management, and the old stand-by, SEO. HubSpot\\u2019s unified platform is popular with inbound sales teams, direct marketers, and customer service experts.\\nHubSpot built its reputation on the innovative nature of its toolset. Users could automate a wide range of marketing functions, optimize ad placement, build newsletters and publish content, even build chatbots. In recent years, these tasks have proven highly amenable to AI enhancement, and HubSpot was quick to see that potential. The company developed Breeze, its AI assistant designed to work within the HubSpot platform.\\nMost importantly, HubSpot is using recent advances in agentic AI to allow users to build or modify their own AI tools. These include customer agents, but the company has an array of new features in late stages of development. Prospecting agents, closing agents, personalization agents, data agents \\u2013 all of these features are coming into play with HubSpot, to give users more flexibility in approaching online marketing. The key point \\u2013 the agents will handle the time-consuming \\u2018busy work,\\u2019 allowing the human behind the scenes to make better decisions based on more accurate data in real time.\\nLike many online subscription services, HubSpot operates on the \\u2018freemium\\u2019 model, giving its registered users an array of basic tools free of charge while reserving the more advanced features for paid subscribers. The model has proven successful; many users are satisfied with the free tools, and their use of HubSpot provides a base for word-of-mouth advertising, while the subscription users provide the company with a sound financial base.\\nHubSpot last reported financial results for 2Q25, and in that period showed a top line of $760.9 million. This was up 19% year-over-year and came in $20.8 million better than had been expected. The company\\u2019s success was driven by its subscription revenue, which at $744.5 million was up 19% year-over-year. HubSpot\\u2019s earnings, $2.19 per share by non-GAAP measures, were 7 cents per share better than had been forecast, and the company had $1.9 billion in liquid assets available at the end of Q2.\\nWe should note here that HubSpot\\u2019s stock is down right now, showing a 35% year-to-date loss. The most recent hit to the stock came last week, when OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, announced a new set of software tools for marketing and customer contact use. This represents a direct challenge to companies like HubSpot \\u2013 although HubSpot, which has been working on AI features for over a year now, has the resources to meet such a challenge.\\nThat is the view of Ryan MacWilliams. In his write-up of HubSpot for Wells Fargo, the analyst notes that the company has proven capable of developing quality tools on a fast timeline, and that gives it an advantage in a challenging environment. MacWilliams writes, \\u201cOur working thesis is that HUBS can add agentic use cases in a reasonable period before a competitor gets to comparable scale\\/breadth of the platform. HubSpot\\u2019s installed base, customer data, and partner ecosystem give it a leg up on distrubution\\/integrations out of the gate. While there will certainly be heightened competition as entrants try to build new agentic solutions, we believe HUBS is attractively positioned to monetize agentic AI (and power users) at scale.\\u201d\\nMacWilliams goes on to rate HUBS as Overweight (i.e., Buy), and gives the stock a $685 price target that suggests a one-year upside potential of 51.5%. (To watch MacWilliams\\u2019 track record, click here)\\nHubSpot\\u2019s Strong Buy consensus rating is based on 29 analyst reviews that include 26 Buys against 3 Holds. The shares are priced at $451.87, and their $686.74 average target price implies a 52% gain in the year to come. (See HUBS stock forecast)\\nAtlassian Corporation (TEAM)\\nThe next stock on our radar here is Atlassian, an international software company (Australia and the US) with 23 years\\u2019 experience in designing and building office collaboration tools. The company offers subscribers a set of software packages designed to link office teams together, to enhance their ability to coordinate and collaborate, and to improve efficiency and creativity in the workplace.\\nAtlassian\\u2019s flagship product, for which it is best known, is Jira, a project management tool that allows supervisors and workers to assign, monitor, and track work projects from concept to completion. Over the years, Atlassian has expanded on the popularity of Jira, and today offers its customers a full stable of software programs and tools, specialized for everything from increasing teamwork and collaboration to promoting online security. And, among the features that Atlassian\\u2019s tools can handle are both AI and coding.\\nThe company\\u2019s Rovo Dev is an agentic AI tool designed to help users build high-end software quickly, without sacrificing quality. Atlassian boasts that Rovo Dev can turn any user\\u2019s terminal into an AI development agent, capable of understanding, coding, and collaborating to bring AI development into the work team. Features include the code planner, code reviewer, deployment summarizer, and pipeline troubleshooter, all built with the assistance of AI agents.\\nIn addition to its in-house array of AI tools, Atlassian is also making moves to expand through acquisition. Last month, the company took steps in this direction. It announced, on September 4, that it had entered an agreement to acquire The Browser Company, the New York-based firm that builds browsers for the AI-powered world. Atlassian will purchase The Browser Company for $610 million in cash.\\nThe second move was announced on September 18, when Atlassian made public its intention to acquire the engineering intelligence firm DX. This move will bring DX\\u2019s capabilities and knowledge to bear on Atlassian\\u2019s array of AI-powered collaboration tools. The DX acquisition will be conducted in both cash and stock, for approximately $1 billion. Both this acquisition and that of The Browser Company above are expected to close during 2Q26.\\nIn the most recent quarterly report, which covered fiscal 4Q25, TEAM beat expectations on both the top and bottom line.Atlassian reported fiscal 4Q revenue of $1.38 billion, up 23% year-over-year and $30 million better than had been anticipated. At the bottom line, the company\\u2019s 98-cent non-GAAP EPS was 13 cents better than the estimates.\\nThe Wells Fargo team is upbeat on Atlassian, citing the company\\u2019s combination of a strong customer base, opportunity for growth, and attractive pricing. Analyst MacWilliams writes, \\u201cOur positive outlook on TEAM is driven by strong pricing, under penetrated upsell\\/crosssell opportunity, cloud migrations, and AI platform opportunity\\u2026 TEAM\\u2019s position in the enterprise stack provides them an opportunity to serve as the orchestration center where non-technical users and developers can organize\\/create AI features+agents. Here TEAM acts as the control tower for development and AI projects across an organization. This position, coupled with faster cloud migrations and the cross-sell and upsell opportunity lead us to believe the durability of TEAM\\u2019s growth algorithm.\\u201d\\nThese comments back up the Overweight (i.e., Buy) rating here, while the analyst\\u2019s $216 price target points toward a one-year gain of 43.5%.\\nThere are 23 recent analyst reviews on record for Atlassian\\u2019s stock, and the 19-to-4 breakdown, favoring Buy over Hold, supports the Strong Buy consensus rating. The shares are priced at $150.49 and have an average price target of $243.52, suggesting an upside of 62% for the next 12 months. (See TEAM stock forecast)\\nBraze(BRZE)\\nLast up is Braze, a software company with a focus on customer engagement for enterprise clients. The company offers its client base a multi-channel, cloud-based marketing platform that allows users to prioritize conversations, building relationships with a target audience as a long-term driver for sales. The Braze platform is designed to help move the potential customer from information to buying, at whatever pace best fits the customer.\\nThis approach is data-driven, and the Braze platform is built to draw that data from a diverse array of sources. This is the wide top of the funnel, and the company\\u2019s enterprise clients use it to engage with their customers, encouraging them to move down the sales funnel through cross-channel messaging that delivers accurate, data-driven information based on real-time analysis. This approach is naturally amenable to the use of AI, in a variety of ways, and Braze boasts that its use of AI is \\u2018rewriting the rules of customer engagement.\\u2019\\nBrazeAI, the company\\u2019s AI-powered platform, is designed to amplify the user\\u2019s efforts, making marketing work more relevant in today\\u2019s fast-evolving tech scene. The AI is designed to create relevant messages, personalized content, and recommendations that lead toward optimal end results. The Braze AI platform automates a large part of the marketing process, allowing for faster responses to customer needs and requests and stronger engagement \\u2013 leading to a more relevant and successful sales funnel.\\nWhat this means for investors is that Braze has built a solid foundation based on quality products and has proven that it can make use of the latest in AI tech. The company has attracted a customer base of top-tier names, including Venmo, Kentucky Fried Chicken, HBOMax, and Yelp. The Braze platform handled 3.9 trillion messages and other actions in 2024 and had a monthly active user base more than 7.4 billion strong. Braze boasted 2,422 enterprise clients as of July 31 this year.\\nIn its fiscal 2Q26 report, the last released, Braze\\u2019s quarterly revenue came to $180.1 million, for a 24% year-over-year gain \\u2013 and an $8.5 million beat compared to expectations. The company realized 15 cents per share in non-GAAP earnings, beating the forecast by 12 cents per share.\\nWe\\u2019ll check in one last time with Wells Fargo and analyst Ryan MacWilliams, who sees agentic AI as the key to Braze\\u2019s continued strength. The analyst writes of Braze, \\u201cAgentic AI advancements and new use cases raise marketing velocity, resulting in more campaigns, messages, triggers, and channels. More complexity is where BRZE excels, as its enterprise customer focus (~62% of ARR) includes the most sophisticated B2C marketing programs. In our view, BRZE is positioned to reap the benefits of an increasingly AI world as more brands utilize BRZE to get an edge with customers.\\u201d\\nMacWilliams follows this with an Overweight (i.e., Buy) rating on BRZE, along with a $40 price target that implies an upside of 41% on the one-year horizon.\\nBraze\\u2019s Strong Buy consensus rating is based on 16 unanimously positive analyst reviews. The shares have a current trading price of $28.42, and their $43.53 average target price suggests that the stock will gain 53% by this time next year.

We'll first explain why, and then we'll present a new analysis of gradient descent that does apply in deep learning.\\nLet's start with the picture that everyone has likely seen before.\\nSuppose that we run gradient descent on a quadratic function\\nIf we run gradient descent on this function with learning rate\\nThe same is true for a quadratic function in multiple dimensions. On a multi-dimensional quadratic, the eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix quantify the curvature along the corresponding eigenvectors.\\nIf any Hessian eigenvalue exceeds the threshold\\nOk, that's quadratics, but what about deep learning objectives? Well, on an arbitrary deep learning objective\\nIn light of this discussion, why does gradient descent work in deep learning?\\nPerhaps the most natural explanation is that gradient descent stays in regions of weight space where the sharpness\\nIndeed, this is the picture suggested by traditional optimization theory (this is \\\"local L-smoothness\\\").\\nYet, as we will now see, the reality in deep learning is quite different.\\nLet's train a neural network using gradient descent with\\nAs we train, we'll plot the evolution of the sharpness\\nYou can see that the sharpness\\nFor the next few iterations of training, we'll plot the train loss and sharpness (as before), but also the displacement of the iterate along the top Hessian eigenvector, i.e. the quantity that is predicted to oscillate.\\nAs you can see, gradient descent does indeed oscillate with growing magnitude along the top Hessian eigenvector, just as a quadratic Taylor approximation would predict. These oscillations eventually grow large enough that the train loss starts to go up instead of down.\\nThings seem to be going poorly. Will gradient descent succeed? It's not clear how it can: so long as the sharpness exceeds\\nLet's see what happens over the next few steps of training:\\nAs if by magic, the sharpness drops. And it drops below\\nBefore we answer this question, let's take a look at the complete training run:\\nYou can see that after rising to\\nIf we try another learning rate, say\\nThese dynamics are quite surprising. If the traditional picture is that gradient descent remains inside the stable region throughout training, then the reality is that gradient descent is frequently exiting the stable region, but is somehow steering itself back inside each time.\\nWe call these dynamics training at the edge of stability (EOS). This behavior is not specific to this network; rather, as far as anyone can tell, it is a universal phenomenon in deep learning. For example, here are several vision architectures trained using gradient descent on a subset of CIFAR-10:\\nAnd here are several sequence architectures trained using gradient descent on a sequence prediction task:\\nNow, practical loss curves don't look quite like this \\u2014 for example, they don't usually have such exaggerated loss spikes. That's because practical training usually uses stochastic optimization, whereas this is deterministic gradient descent. We study gradient descent because, as the simplest optimizer, understanding gradient descent would seem to be a necessary stepping stone to understanding SGD. Similar phenomena do occur during SGD and in fact, the study of related phenomena was first pioneered by Stanis\\u0142aw Jastrz\\u0119bski in the context of SGD.\\nSeveral years ago, one of us (Jeremy) wrote a paper which showed that gradient descent exhibits these EOS dynamics, and posed the question:\\nIn response, the other of us (Alex) co-wrote a paper that gave an explanation. It turns out that the key to understanding these gradient descent dynamics is to consider a third-order Taylor expansion of the objective, which is one order higher than is normally used when analyzing gradient descent. A third-order Taylor expansion reveals the key ingredient missing from traditional optimization theory:\\nLet's sketch this argument informally.\\nSuppose that gradient descent is oscillating along the top Hessian eigenvector,\\nHow does the gradient at\\nSince\\nThe \\\"magic\\\" comes from the next term in the Taylor expansion:\\nThis term looks a little intimidating at first, but let's unpack it.\\nThe quantity\\nThus, when gradient descent is oscillating along the top Hessian eigenvector with magnitude\\nEquipped with this new insight, we can finally understand the behavior of gradient descent that we previously observed:\\nWhen gradient descent leaves the stable region, it starts to oscillate with growing magnitude along the top Hessian eigenvector. At first, these oscillations are small, so their effect on the sharpness is negligible. But the oscillations soon grow large enough to exert a non-negligible sharpness-reduction effect. This acts to decrease the sharpness, pushing gradient descent back into the stable region, after which point the oscillations shrink.\\nIn effect, a third-order Taylor approximation reveals that gradient descent has in-built negative feedback mechanism for regulating sharpness:\\nwhen the sharpness\\nIn the special case where there is exactly one eigenvalue at the edge of stability, the EOS dynamics consist of consecutive cycles of the kind we just saw, where the sharpness first rises above, and then is pushed below, the value\\nHowever, it is common for more than one eigenvalue to eventually reach the edge of stability.\\nThe dynamics with multiple eigenvalues at EOS are more complex, and may be chaotic in the technical sense.\\nWhen there are\\nWhile these dynamics are challenging to analyze, the key insight of our new paper is that understanding the EOS dynamics in fine-grained detail may not be necessary. Rather, we argue that the more important question is: what macroscopic path does gradient descent take through weight space? The goal of our analysis will be to derive a differential equation called a central flow that characterizes this path.\\nThe usual continuous-time approximation to gradient descent is the gradient flow:\\nThe reason is that gradient flow never oscillates, and hence allows the sharpness to keep rising beyond\\nOur central flow is a differential equation that characterizes the trajectory of gradient descent even at the edge of stability. The central flow is depicted by a black dashed line in the following animation:\\nThe central flow models the time-averaged (i.e. locally smoothed) trajectory of gradient descent, as illustrated in the following cartoon of the weight-space dynamics:\\nWe'll derive the central flow using informal mathematical reasoning, and we will then validate its accuracy experimentally. Essentially, our logic proceeds as follows: (1) We will assume that the time-averaged trajectory of gradient descent can be captured by a differential equation. (2) We will argue that only one differential equation makes sense (the central flow). (3) Finally, we will show empirically that this central flow does indeed match the long-term trajectory of gradient descent in a variety of deep learning settings.\\nRigorously establishing that gradient descent follows the central flow is an important open problem that is beyond the scope of our paper. Such an analysis would require making assumptions about the objective that we would not know how to justify, and would demand analytical tools that go beyond the usual toolkit of optimization theory. We hope that our compelling experimental results will inspire future efforts aimed at establishing a rigorous basis for similar analyses.\\nLet's start our derivation by considering the special case where only one eigenvalue is at the edge of stability.\\nThe central flow\\nTherefore, by Taylor expansion, the gradient at the iterate is:\\nTherefore, if we abuse notation and use\\nThat is, the time-averaged gradient equals the gradient at the time-averaged iterate, plus a term proportional to the gradient of the sharpness.\\nThe latter scales with\\nBased on this calculation, we make the ansatz that the time-averaged dynamics of gradient descent\\ncan be captured by a sharpness-penalized gradient flow that follows this time-averaged gradient:\\nwhere\\nTo set\\nTo see why, note that the time derivative of the sharpness under a flow of the form\\nThe first term is the time derivative of the sharpness under gradient flow, which will be positive (as otherwise we would have left the edge of stability).\\nThe second term is the sharpness reduction that is induced by the oscillations.\\nBasic algebra shows that there is a unique value of\\nThe central flow is defined as equation\\nLet's check out this central flow in action. Starting at the point in training where the sharpness first reaches\\nThe left pane shows that the sharpness cycles around\\nThe middle pane shows that our formula\\nThe right pane shows that the gradient descent stays close to the central flow over time. In particular, it shows that the Euclidean distance between these two processes remains small. In contrast, the figure below shows that the distance between gradient descent and the gradient flow starts to grow large once training enters EOS:\\nThus, although our analysis utilizes informal mathematical reasoning, we can see that this analysis yields precise, nontrivial numerical predictions about the optimization dynamics.\\nSo far, we have focused on the special case where only one eigenvalue is at the edge of stability.\\nBut the central flow formalism extends more generally to the setting where an arbitrary number of eigenvalues can be at the edge of stability (including zero).\\nIn general, we model gradient descent as displaced from its time-averaged trajectory\\nGoing through a similar argument as before, we arrive at the ansatz that the time-averaged iterates of gradient descent follow a flow of the form:\\nAs before, to determine\\nIt turns out that there is a unique value of\\nLet's now watch the central flow in action:\\nInitially, all Hessian eigenvalues are below\\nOn the right, observe that the distance between the gradient descent and the central flow stays small over time, whereas the distance between gradient descent and gradient flow starts to grow large once the dynamics enter EOS. (The red line ends early because we stop discretizing gradient flow once the sharpness gets high enough that discretization becomes too challenging.)\\nNow for the coolest part, in our subjective opinion.\\nAs before, we can verify that our prediction\\nWe think this is really cool. While the oscillations appear to be chaotic, they obey a hidden underlying order \\u2014 namely, their covariance is predictable. Moreover, the long-term trajectory of gradient descent only depends on the oscillations via this covariance. Thus, we don't need to understand the exact oscillations to understand the long-term path taken by gradient descent \\u2014 we just need to understand their covariance, which is much easier.\\nOK, so we've shown that the central flow takes the same long-term path as gradient descent. But, one might ask, if they're the same, then why is one better? Well, as a smooth curve, the central flow is a fundamentally simpler object than the oscillatory gradient descent trajectory. For example, under the gradient descent trajectory, the network's predictions evolve erratically, due to the oscillations:\\nBy contrast, since the central flow is a smooth curve, everything (including the network's predictions) evolves smoothly under the central flow:\\nPhilosophically, we think of the central flow as the \\\"true\\\" training process, and we regard the actual gradient descent trajectory as merely a \\\"noisy\\\" approximation to this true underlying process.\\nIn particular, let's use the central flow perspective to understand something that every deep learning practitioner is familiar with: the train loss curve. Here's what a typical gradient descent loss curve looks like:\\nAs you can see, the loss behaves non-monotonically over short-timescales, while only decreasing over long-timescales. This makes it challenging to reason about the progress of optimization.\\nIn contrast, the central flow's loss curve\\nIn fact, it is possible to prove that the central flow decreases the loss monotonically:\\nAs you can see above, the loss along the central flow is consistently lower than the loss along the gradient descent trajectory. The intuitive explanation is that at EOS, gradient descent can be viewed as \\\"bouncing between valley walls\\\", whereas the central flow moves nearly along the \\\"valley floor.\\\" The loss is higher on the valley walls, when gradient descent is located, than on the valley floor, where the central flow is located.\\nFortunately, because the central flow models the covariance\\nThe following animation shows that this prediction is quite accurate:\\nThe loss along the central flow\\nThe same principle applies to the gradient norm.\\nThe gradient norm along the central flow is much smaller than the gradient norm along the gradient descent trajectory, since most of the latter is\\ndominated by the back-and-forth oscillations \\\"across the valley\\\" that cancel out over the long run.\\nNevertheless, by leveraging\\nAlthough this post has focused on a particular ViT as a running example, we stress that our analysis is fully generic, and applies across a variety of architectures and tasks. For example, here we show real vs. predicted loss curves for a variety of deep learning settings:\\nPlease see the paper for a discussion of the circumstances under which the central flow is a good approximation to gradient descent.\\nInterested in this line of work?

As AI applications proliferate across every sector of the global economy - from autonomous vehicles navigating complex urban environments to personalized medical diagnostics processing vast genomic datasets - the computational demands have outstripped the capabilities of traditional silicon-based architectures. The convergence of neuromorphic computing, quantum computing, and edge AI processors represents not merely an evolutionary advancement, but a fundamental paradigm shift that will determine the trajectory of artificial intelligence for the next decade and beyond. This technological convergence emerges from the recognition that different AI workloads require fundamentally different computational approaches. Traditional von Neumann architectures, which have powered the digital revolution for over half a century, face insurmountable challenges in meeting the diverse requirements of modern AI systems: the massive parallel processing demands of training large language models, the ultra-low latency requirements of autonomous systems, the energy constraints of mobile and IoT devices, and the real-time adaptation capabilities needed for dynamic environments.\\nThe semiconductor industry's adherence to Moore's Law - the observation that transistor density doubles approximately every two years - has reached fundamental physical limits. As transistors approach atomic dimensions, quantum effects, manufacturing costs, and power density challenges have made continued scaling increasingly difficult. This limitation has profound implications for AI development, as the exponential growth in model complexity and data volumes can no longer be supported through traditional scaling approaches. The response has been a decisive shift toward domain-specific architectures optimized for particular AI workloads. Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) initiated this transformation by providing massively parallel processing capabilities for training deep neural networks. Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) followed, offering specialized acceleration for matrix operations core to machine learning algorithms. However, these solutions represent only the beginning of a more profound architectural revolution.\\nNeuromorphic computing draws inspiration from the human brain's remarkable efficiency and adaptability, implementing spiking neural networks that process information only when events occur, dramatically reducing power consumption compared to traditional continuously-operating processors. This event-driven processing paradigm proves particularly valuable for applications requiring always-on sensing and real-time adaptation, such as autonomous vehicles processing sensor data or IoT devices monitoring environmental conditions.\\nThe technology's commercial viability has been demonstrated through pioneering implementations including Intel's Loihi 2 neuromorphic research chip and IBM's TrueNorth processor. Startups like BrainChip have commercialized neuromorphic accelerators for edge AI applications, while companies like Prophesee have developed neuromorphic vision sensors capable of capturing high-speed motion with microsecond temporal resolution and minimal power consumption. Beyond energy efficiency, neuromorphic systems offer unique advantages in handling temporal data, performing in-memory computation, and enabling continuous learning without extensive retraining. These capabilities prove essential for applications ranging from industrial predictive maintenance to augmented reality systems requiring real-time environmental understanding.\\nQuantum computing represents perhaps the most revolutionary advancement in computational capability since the invention of digital computers. By leveraging quantum phenomena including superposition and entanglement, quantum systems can potentially solve certain classes of problems exponentially faster than classical computers. For artificial intelligence, this capability promises transformative advances in optimization, pattern recognition, and machine learning algorithm development. Quantum machine learning algorithms like quantum support vector machines and quantum neural networks demonstrate the potential for processing vast datasets more efficiently than classical approaches. Quantum optimization algorithms show particular promise for solving complex combinatorial problems common in AI applications, from drug discovery molecular simulations to financial portfolio optimization and supply chain management.\\nMajor technology companies including IBM, Google, and IonQ have developed increasingly sophisticated quantum processors, while cloud-based quantum computing services democratize access to quantum capabilities for AI researchers and developers. The integration of quantum and classical computing through hybrid architectures enables practical applications that leverage quantum advantages while maintaining compatibility with existing AI workflows. The proliferation of connected devices and the need for real-time AI processing has driven the development of specialized edge AI processors capable of running sophisticated algorithms directly on mobile devices, IoT sensors, and embedded systems. This distributed intelligence paradigm addresses critical limitations of cloud-based AI processing: network latency, bandwidth constraints, privacy concerns, and the need for autonomous operation in connectivity-challenged environments.\\nEdge AI processors employ diverse architectural approaches including dedicated neural processing units (NPUs), analog computing techniques, and neuromorphic processing elements optimized for specific workloads. Companies like NVIDIA with their Jetson ecosystem, Qualcomm with integrated AI accelerators, and startups like Mythic with analog matrix processors are pioneering solutions that deliver increasingly sophisticated AI capabilities within the power and size constraints of edge devices.\\nThe convergence of these three technological domains creates unprecedented opportunities for solving AI's most challenging problems. Neuromorphic principles could enhance quantum error correction and control systems. Quantum algorithms might accelerate neuromorphic network training and optimization. Edge processors could enable hybrid quantum-classical computing workflows and distribute neuromorphic processing capabilities across IoT networks.

That\\u2019s according to a report late Monday (Oct. 6) by the\\nThat trade launched Graham\\u2019s career and established him as the de facto father of value investing. Over the next several decades, his Graham-Newman Partnership would generate above-average annualized returns by doing one thing very well: finding inefficiencies in markets and moving fast enough to capture them before those windows closed.\\nFrom 1980 through 2003, Graham\\u2019s most famous protegee, Warren Buffett, used the same arbitrage principles to produce Berkshire Hathaway\\u2019s own above-average annualized returns. He did that by taking a page from Graham\\u2019s playbook: find investments with spreads between what it\\u2019s trading for today and what it\\u2019s worth tomorrow, then monetize the difference.\\nFinancial markets are built on spreads, the differences in price, risk or timing that smart investors use to create value. The best investors do not invent opportunity. Instead, they look for market inefficiencies and move fast enough to capture them before the market corrects.\\nNow, a similar kind of spread has opened up in the daily lives of people and businesses.\\nThat difference, the time spread, can be captured, reinvested and compounded.\\n|\\nAnd it has nothing to do with currencies, stock markets or interest rates. It\\u2019s about the spread between what something once cost in time spent and what it costs now in time saved in the age of Gen AI.\\nAdvertisement: Scroll to Continue\\nGen AI is giving people and businesses the capability to produce more, faster and better, with less time and effort. That difference, the time spread, can be captured, reinvested and compounded.\\nIt is the newest form of asset class: time arbitrage.\\nThe Economics of Time Arbitrage\\nIn financial markets, arbitrage works because inefficiencies exist. In everyday life and business, inefficiency exists too. It shows up as friction. The waiting and reworking, the different hoops to jump through, the endless clicks and scrolls, approvals that take days and weeks to finalize, the hopscotching between apps and web sites and forms. It all amounts to the waste of the most precious of human assets: our time.\\nConsider this from the business perspective. The average U.S. worker earns roughly $45 an hour and works roughly 1800 hours a year. If Gen AI eliminates just 15% of their low-value effort, that\\u2019s 270 hours of time returned per person. Or, using this formula, about $12,000 in annualized value for each worker.\\nAcross 163 million U.S. workers, that\\u2019s more than a $1.9 trillion productivity dividend, equal to 6.4% of the U.S. GDP. In other words, time that can be released for other productive work which can, in turn, boost GDP.\\nTo paraphrase the immortal words of Muhammad Ali, that ain\\u2019t nothing.\\nConsumers experience the same phenomenon in their daily lives.\\nEach year, they spend three hours just opening apps, and another six managing billing errors, rescheduling appointments, and fixing travel plans.\\nThat\\u2019s a more than a full workday of lost effort every year.\\nGen AI will erase much of that lost time, compressing mundane tasks into milliseconds.\\n|\\nGen AI can eliminate much of that, compressing mundane tasks that took hours and days into milliseconds.\\nThose reclaimed hours are the time spread, whether they are coming from improved business productivity or greater consumer productivity. They are the fuel for new value creation.\\nSo, there is no longer the question of whether we\\u2019ll save time. We will. The question becomes how people, businesses and the economy will reinvest it.\\nTime as the Next Asset Class\\nTime has always been finite, but Gen AI has made it more liquid. It frees trapped capacity the same way financial innovation once freed trapped capital.\\nBenjamin Franklin said, \\u201cLost time is never found again.\\u201d But in a Gen AI-powered world, time can, in a sense, be reclaimed, multiplied and redeployed.\\nTime arbitrage turns hours into capital that can be redeployed. Just as compound interest transformed investing, compounding time will transform productivity and creativity. Every hour saved using advanced AI becomes an hour that can be reinvested. In learning, invention, spending time with family, training a new pup, reading a book or doing absolutely nothing at all.\\nAnd as with financial capital, the real advantage comes not from saving time, but from what consumers and businesses do with those extra hours.\\nThe New Market Makers of Time\\nIn finance, market makers create liquidity. They match buyers and sellers, price risk, and profit from the spread.\\nIn the time economy, the large language models such as GPT, Gemini, Claude, Mistral, and others are the new market makers. In a sense, they set the \\u201cexchange rate\\u201d between human effort and machine output.\\nThe real advantage comes from what consumers and businesses do with those extra hours.\\n|\\nA prompt can be thought of as the bid. An answer, design, video, ad copy or insight is the ask. Each interaction defines a new unit of efficiency. How much time it takes to achieve a result.\\nChatGPT turns a two-hour analysis into two minutes of synthesized context. Copilot organizes and prioritizes an overflowing inbox. Gemini drafts an investor brief or product roadmap in real time. Perplexity and Claude summarize hundreds of pages in seconds. All of these models are exploring how to monetize the spread in different ways, through subscription revenues or transaction fees on ecommerce purchases and on advertising.\\nThese models don\\u2019t just perform tasks; they create liquidity in time and they will monetize the friction they reduce or eliminate. And by doing that, they give every worker, creator and consumer a personal time arbitrage opportunity. And those models a way to monetize the spread.\\nHow Businesses Monetize the Time Spread\\nDespite media hype to the contrary, the most sophisticated companies aren\\u2019t just asking, \\u201cHow do we save time?\\u201d They\\u2019re asking, \\u201cHow do we reinvest our collective workforce capacity to become a different company?\\u201d Part of the answer may be that they don\\u2019t need as many workers, who then become available for other companies that do.\\nWhen Klarna reported that it had deployed AI agents to handle customer service inquiries, the company claimed to have freed 1.4 million workhours annually. It said that it reallocated that capacity into fraud prevention innovation, new product development in business banking, and advanced credit risk analytics. Klarna claims that the value of that time arbitrage resulted in an estimated $40 million of annual profit improvement.\\nAI revolutionized vaccine development by turning years-long processes into weeks using advanced algorithms. Moderna used them to develop its COVID-19 vaccine in just 42 days using 750+ active AI models. Pfizer\\u2019s Smart Data Query system analyzed data from 44,000 trial participants in real time, cutting trial validation from 30 days to 22 hours. These data-driven efficiencies compressed vaccine development to under 9 months, setting a new benchmark for AI-powered biomedical innovation.\\nAnd new capacity for innovative thinking.\\nThe same workforce doesn\\u2019t do 15% more of the same work. It may do entirely new work that generates returns.\\n|\\nConsumers as the New Supply Side\\nPlatforms like Uber, Lyft, Door Dash, Fivvr and others give consumers the ability to monetize idle capacity, on demand and as it suits them. Marketplaces and streaming platforms like Amazon, eBay, Etsy, and Spotify provide distribution for microprenuers to create and make sales. Gen AI has the potential to expand consumer capacity for those platforms and others by monetizing their \\u201ctime equity.\\u201d Every free minute becomes a new potential opportunity for personal, business and economic growth. They are expanding the supply of ideas, products and services that fuel growth.\\nConsumers don\\u2019t just create demand for products and services anymore. They create supply and do that at scale. The solopreneur building a brand on new found evening hours. The student launching a micro-SaaS business with weekend capacity. The retiree turning expertise into an AI-powered consulting practice. The single mom converting wait time at her daughter\\u2019s dance classes into a side-hustle.\\nIt\\u2019s a flywheel: Gen AI saves people time. People reinvest that time into creation, education or starting new businesses. Those outputs feed demand for smarter and better tools. Smarter tools save more time. More time equals more creation, education, businesses and business outcomes.\\nIn the industrial economy, supply was constrained by labor. In the time arbitrage economy, supply grows with every person who reinvests their time.\\nMcKinsey research suggests that if U.S. businesses shifted from extracting time savings as cost reductions to reinvesting them to support innovation, the economy could generate an additional $2 to 4 trillion in new output by 2030. Not from working more hours. From monetizing the time arbitrage. The space between what used to take days and what now takes minutes.\\nMore Failures Faster\\nCompanies that use Gen AI only for cost reduction will see diminishing returns. The ones that reinvest time into innovation, using automation and autonomy to fund experimentation, R&D and creativity, will reap the benefits of the compounding of time across their workforce.\\nThis creates a compounding effect that traditional ROI doesn\\u2019t capture. Companies don\\u2019t just get more innovation per dollar; they get more kinds of innovation. From more people. With more perspectives. And that opens the door to bigger, more diverse breakthroughs.\\nReturn on Innovation is measured by how much more time can be spent moving from an idea to a finished product.\\n|\\nThat\\u2019s the new kind of ROI, Return on Innovation, measured by how much more time can be spent moving from an idea to a finished product.\\nWhen projects that once took months can now be tested in days, failure becomes affordable. When experiments cost hundreds of dollars instead of hundreds of thousands, people and companies are more willing to take calculated risks. When the time from idea to prototype shrinks from quarters to days, innovation stops being something only special teams do. It becomes part of everyone\\u2019s job, happening all the time, across the organization.\\nWith Gen AI, it\\u2019s possible for people work at the speed of their ideas. Previously, the lag between conception and manifestation created friction. Someone would have an idea, spend hours bringing it into being, getting consensus and building the business case. By the time they saw it realized, the thinking had moved on. Maybe so had the market opportunity.\\nTime arbitrage makes creativity move in parallel streams. People can explore multiple paths at the same time. Test assumptions in real-time. Follow hunches without committing days and weeks to what could turn out to be dead ends.\\nThe Aha Moment and the Reordering of Time\\nIn a February 2025 Scientific American article, researchers published a study of the neuroscience of \\u201caha\\u201d moments. We\\u2019ve all had them. The new idea that pops into your head out of the blue. On a run, or while making dinner or walking the dog. Scientists say that these flashes of \\u201cbrilliance\\u201d are the result of a burst of high-frequency activity in the right temporal lobe, that palm-to-the-forehead moment that envisions a new twist or unsticks something that felt stuck. The brain, having stopped focusing on the task at hand, responds to being unincumbered by reassembling old information in a new way.\\nGen AI has the potential to create more of those moments. By handing off the mundane parts of day-to-day management at home or at the office, people can use their time arbitrage to focus on new thinking. Gen AI doesn\\u2019t create the aha moment, but it could give more people more opportunities to have them.\\nThe Future of Time as Capital\\nBen Graham spent his career teaching investors how to turn a dollar into two. He taught them to calculate intrinsic value, identify the spread and capture it before markets corrected. His students, like Warren Buffett, built fortunes on this single insight: inefficiency is an opportunity that can be monetized at scale.\\nPeople can use their time arbitrage to focus on new thinking.\\n|\\nGraham died in 1976, decades before ChatGPT, Claude or Gemini existed. But he would have understood the impact of those tools on his thesis.\\nThe greatest market inefficiency we\\u2019ve ever seen isn\\u2019t in commodities or finance. It\\u2019s in how human time is valued and spent. Time has always been the scarcest yet most ubiquitous form of capital. Every person has a supply of time to spend. Now time is becoming the most liquid. In the Gen AI era, reclaimed time can be found, multiplied and reinvested.\\nWhat used to take hours now takes minutes. What used to take days now takes hours. What used to require teams now requires prompts. The spread between old time costs and new time costs is massive. And it\\u2019s available to anyone with access to these tools.\\nThe question for every person and business is the same one Graham and his protegees asked about every investment: How to capture and reinvest the spread?\\nFor individuals, the return is new opportunity. For businesses, it is a new source of competitive advantage. For economies, it is the compounding effects of innovation with the potential to touch everyone and deliver change. At scale.\\nHow will you spend your time?\\nUntil NEXT time.\\nJoin the 18,000 subscribers who\\u2019ve already said yes to what\\u2019s NEXT.\"\n",

And yet how to best use large language models and the GenAI tools based on them continues to be a puzzle.\\nDespite its ubiquity, generative AI is still young. So it\\u2019s no surprise that many leaders are struggling with important questions about using the tools efficiently, responsibly, and skeptically. The questions are significant: Can we trust it? What should our strategy be in deploying it and scaling success? Who should be using it? How will we measure its ROI? When should we use other types of AI, like machine learning, instead?\\nMIT Sloan Management Review authors on this topic \\u2014 including academics, researchers, and practitioners \\u2014 are reporting from the front lines about the best GenAI questions to ask and how to think about answering them.\\nTake our columnist Rama Ramakrishnan, professor of the practice at the MIT Sloan School of Management. He writes that many of his executive students who use GenAI wonder about a typical use case: If they include documents as part of a prompt, is there a way to ensure that the LLM will use only the provided documents when it generates the response? His answer: No.\\n\\u201cWhile careful prompting and techniques like RAG [retrieval-augmented generation] can encourage an AI model to prioritize a set of provided documents, standard LLMs cannot be forced to use only that content,\\u201d Ramakrishnan explains. \\u201cThe model still has access to patterns and facts it learned during training and may blend that knowledge into its response \\u2014 especially if the training data included similar content.\\u201d\\nStraightforward question; straightforward answer. Below, you\\u2019ll find Ramakrishnan\\u2019s article, along with seven others, chosen because they\\u2019re similarly straightforward. Use them to help ground you in what\\u2019s happening with this complex part of the technology landscape.\\n1. How LLMs Work: Top 10 Executive-Level Questions\\nRama Ramakrishnan\\n\\u201cIn my work at MIT Sloan School of Management, I have taught the basics of how large language models (LLMs) work to many executives during the past two years.\\n\\u201cSome people posit that business leaders neither want to nor need to know how LLMs and the generative AI tools that they power work \\u2014 and are interested only in the results the tools can deliver. That is not my experience. \\u2026\\n\\u201cIn this column, I share questions on 10 often-misunderstood topics that I am often asked about, along with their answers. \\u2026\\n\\u201c[For instance,] when does the LLM decide to give the user the final answer to a question? The decision to stop generating is determined by a combination of what the LLM predicts and the rules set by the software system running it. It is not a choice made by the LLM alone.\\u201d Read the full article \\u00bb\\n2. How to Scale GenAI in the Workplace\\nMichael Wade, Konstantinos Trantopoulos, Mark Navas, and Anders Romare\\n\\u201cAs companies move from experimentation to enterprisewide adoption, many struggle not with the tools themselves but with the organizational transformation required to integrate them meaningfully into people\\u2019s daily work. Tools will keep evolving: It is the human side of the equation that determines whether GenAI initiatives truly succeed.\\n\\u201cWe studied one of the largest real-world generative AI deployments to date \\u2014 at multinational pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk. Its experience shows that success hinges not just on infrastructure but on how people think, adapt, and collaborate with AI. One critical lesson: While GenAI adoption and broader digital transformations have common roots, generative AI is uniquely disruptive, reshaping the nature of work itself in unprecedented ways. \\u2026\\n\\u201cEach employee saved 2.17 hours per week, on average, once they began using the tool. But something unexpected also happened: Those hours weren\\u2019t what employees valued most. Employee satisfaction with Copilot was three times more strongly correlated with perceived improvements in work quality than with time saved. Employees reported quality enhancements in content summarization, content creation, and ideation. Interestingly, many employees reinvested the time they saved into people interactions, strategic planning, and creative work.\\u201d Read the full article \\u00bb\\n3. Generate Value From GenAI With \\u2018Small t\\u2019 Transformations\\nMelissa Webster and George Westerman\\n\\u201cBusiness leaders are finding ways to derive real value from large language models (LLMs) without complete replacements of existing business processes. They\\u2019re pursuing \\u2018small t\\u2019 transformation, even as they build the foundation for larger transformations to come. \\u2026\\n\\u201cOur project team interviewed the senior managers of various functions, including artificial intelligence, data science, innovation, operations, and sales, at 21 large companies. We focused on understanding what organizations with relatively early and broad GenAI adoption are doing and why. \\u2026\\n\\u201cOur research shows that most companies are following a more targeted approach to transforming with generative AI. While GenAI can potentially increase the speed and quality of many tasks, it also comes with a variety of risks around accuracy, security, and intellectual property management. The leaders we interviewed tend to apply the logic of a risk slope when making their decisions, attaching a higher risk to customer-facing processes than to internal ones.\\u201d Read the full article \\u00bb\\n4. The GenAI Focus Shifts to Innovation at Colgate-Palmolive\\nThomas H. Davenport and Randy Bean\\n\\u201cThe large language models (LLMs) that Colgate-Palmolive\\u2019s teams use have been augmented with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) content of various types \\u2014 proprietary research that the company conducts, Google search trends, syndicated data sources, and more. RAG-based systems draw more on company-specific content than on public internet materials, so there is a lower likelihood of hallucinations.\\n\\u201cGenerative AI can quickly go through such material and describe market trends and unmet consumer needs. That means that instead of downloading, reading, and notating a broad collection of market research reports when they want consumer insights, employees can just write the question they want answered in a prompt and immediately get a response. \\u2026\\n\\u201cColgate-Palmolive\\u2019s teams found that they could combine one AI system that surfaces unmet consumer needs with another proprietary AI system that develops new product concepts to meet those needs. In minutes, with human guidance, it can produce copy and imagery for a new concept, such as a new flavor of toothpaste. While there are always humans in the loop to guide the workflow, using the GenAI-enhanced system is much more efficient than having humans page through market research materials. The breadth of ideas generated also creates a broader product funnel for the company to pursue.\\u201d Read the full article \\u00bb\\n5. Bring Your Own AI: How to Balance Risks and Innovation\\nNick van der Meulen and Barbara H. Wixom\\n\\u201cWith this rise of GenAI comes a new challenge for organizational leaders: the phenomenon of Bring Your Own AI (BYOAI), which occurs when employees use unvetted, publicly available GenAI tools for work.\\n\\u201cWhile these tools promise greater productivity and creative potential, they also bring organizational security and governance risks, including data loss, intellectual property leakage, copyright violations, and security breaches. \\u2026\\n\\u201cGiven the risks associated with BYOAI, it may seem logical for leaders to consider banning unvetted GenAI tools outright. The prospect of uncontrolled GenAI use, combined with the uncertainty around legal and regulatory exposure, can understandably make leaders cautious. However, the executives we interviewed said that banning BYOAI is neither practical nor effective. Employees \\u2014 especially those already feeling stretched thin \\u2014 often turn to GenAI tools to enhance their personal productivity. Restricting access only pushes them to find unofficial workarounds, potentially bypassing established governance frameworks.\\u201d Read the full article \\u00bb\\n6. Stop Deploying AI. Start Designing Intelligence\\nMichael Schrage and David Kiron\\n\\u201cAs part of our ongoing \\u2018Philosophy Eats AI\\u2019 exploration \\u2014 the thesis that foundational philosophical clarity is essential to the future value of intelligent systems \\u2014 we find that [physicist-turned-entrepreneur Stephen] Wolfram\\u2019s fundamental insights about computation have distinctly actionable, if underappreciated, uses for leaders overwhelmed by AI capabilities but underwhelmed by AI returns. \\u2026\\n\\u201cHis life\\u2019s work now offers crucial frameworks for both understanding and applying AI in the real world. His insights aren\\u2019t clever academic flourishes; they\\u2019re imperatives for building intelligence environments that function effectively at scale. \\u2026\\n\\u201cWith Wolfram, we explored the idea that AI leadership must shift from better adopting and integrating AI tools to designing intelligence environments, organizational architectures in which human and artificial agents proactively interact to create strategic value. Three insights from his philosophical approach to computation emerged as fundamental to this design challenge, offering a fresh perspective on why traditional approaches to AI adoption fail and what must replace them.\\u201d Read the full article \\u00bb\\n7. The Hidden Costs of Coding With Generative AI\\nEdward Anderson, Geoffrey Parker, and Burcu Tan\\n\\u201cOrganizations adopting these tools are anticipating major gains. And early research supports their optimism: GitHub has reported that programmers using Copilot are up to 55% more productive, and McKinsey has found that developers can complete tasks up to twice as fast with generative AI assistance.\\n\\u201cBut these positive indicators come with a major caveat. The studies were conducted in controlled environments where programmers completed isolated tasks \\u2014 not in real-world settings, where software must be built atop complex existing systems. When the use of AI-generated code is scaled rapidly or applied to brownfield (legacy) environments, the risks are much greater and much harder to manage. \\u2026\\n\\u201cWhen an organization rapidly introduces new software into existing systems, it can inadvertently create a tangle of dependencies that compounds its technical debt \\u2014 that is, the cost of additional technological work that will be needed in the future to address shortcuts taken and quick fixes made during development. \\u2026\\n\\u201cOrganizations must treat AI tools\\u2019 tendency to increase technical debt as a strategic risk, not just an operational nuisance.\\u201d Read the full article \\u00bb\\n8. When to Use GenAI Versus Predictive AI\\nRama Ramakrishnan\\n\\u201cWhile generative AI promises to revolutionize everything from customer service to product development, its optimal role alongside predictive AI tools (that is, machine learning and deep learning tools) remains a work in progress. That often leaves leaders asking what the right approach is for addressing a particular problem. \\u2026\\n\\u201cTo effectively use traditional machine learning with unstructured data, the data must be manually structured \\u2014 an expensive task that makes machine learning unattractive for business use cases where the input data is not tabular. \\u2026\\n\\u201cThe inputs and outputs of generative AI systems like LLMs are typically unstructured. Most commonly, they comprise text and\\/or image data and, more recently, videos. Note that the text being analyzed by and created from generative AI tools encompasses an astonishing range of types, such as software code, protein sequences, music notation, mathematical expressions, and chemical formulas. \\u2026\\n\\u201cLet\\u2019s start with the easy case. If you have a generation problem to solve, there\\u2019s only one game in town: generative AI. Depending on the sort of output you want to generate, you may need to use multimodal LLMs, like OpenAI\\u2019s GPT-4, Anthropic\\u2019s Claude 3.7 Sonnet, or Google\\u2019s Gemini 1.5; text-to-image models, like Dall-E; or special-purpose models that have been built for audio and other domains.\\n\\u201cIf you have a prediction problem, however, matters become more complicated.\\u201d Read the full article \\u00bb\\nAdditional Resources: Apply AI Lessons With Your Team\\nGenAI: The Strategy + Governance Toolkit\\nMIT Sloan Management Review developed its Generative AI Strategy + Governance Toolkit with five of the world\\u2019s foremost experts on generative AI leadership: Ethan Mollick (University of Pennsylvania\\u2019s Wharton School), John Sviokla (Harvard Business School and GAI Insights), John K. Thompson (Hackett Group and the University of Michigan), George Westerman (MIT Sloan School of Management), and David A. Wood (Brigham Young University\\u2019s Marriott School of Business).\\nThe kit includes a video lesson with Westerman, a GenAI strategy planner, a GenAI strategy checklist, a GenAI governance planner, articles, and more.\"\n",

Crunch Lab is betting $5 million that the answer is yes.\\nOn October 7, 2025, Crunch Lab announced it secured $5 million in funding co-led by Galaxy Ventures and Road Capital, with participation from VanEck and Multicoin. The round, which closed in June, brings the company's total funding to $10 million after a $3.5 million seed round in 2024. The company builds what it calls an \\\"intelligence layer\\\" for decentralized AI, connecting enterprises with a network of more than 10,000 machine learning engineers and 1,200 PhDs through its platform, CrunchDAO.\\nThe concept challenges how organizations approach AI development. Instead of spending years recruiting specialists or building internal teams, enterprises submit problems as encrypted modeling challenges. Contributors compete to build solutions, and rewards flow to whoever delivers the best results. The Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA) Research Lab reported a 17% improvement in cross-sectional asset pricing predictions using this method. The Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard used the network for cancer gene research with computer vision. A global investment bank now runs Mid+One, a crowdsourced pricing engine for FX OTC markets, in production.\\nThe funding reflects growing interest in decentralized approaches to AI infrastructure. Galaxy Ventures, Road Capital, VanEck, and Multicoin have all made bets that collective intelligence models can compete with centralized alternatives. The company was also selected for the Solana Incubator's second cohort earlier in 2025, and the platform operates on Solana's blockchain.\\nThe Economics of Talent Scarcity\\nHiring specialists in machine learning costs money. A senior ML engineer in the United States commands an average salary between $150,000 and $250,000 per year, according to industry data. Building a team of 10 to 20 engineers to tackle predictive modeling can easily exceed $2 million annually before factoring in infrastructure, benefits, or retention costs. Enterprises in finance, healthcare, and technology compete for the same limited pool of candidates.\\nCrunch Lab's model offers a different path. Instead of hiring full-time staff, companies post modeling challenges. Thousands of engineers participate, and organizations pay only for results. Jean Herelle, CEO of Crunch Lab and CrunchDAO, said, \\\"AI today is constrained by hiring bottlenecks, siloed teams and an inability to scale effectively. We've flipped that model. Instead of competing for scarce talent, we give enterprises secure access to all of it through a decentralized network.\\\"\\nThe approach mirrors crowdsourcing platforms like Kaggle, but with a focus on production deployment rather than competition alone. Companies submit real problems, not academic exercises. Contributors work with encrypted data, so proprietary information stays protected. The network then aggregates predictions from multiple models to generate final outputs. Herelle added, \\\"This isn't theoretical hype, it's proven. When thousands of practitioners compete, you uncover solutions even the best internal teams miss.\\\"\\nProven Performance in High-Stakes Environments\\nResults matter more than promises in AI. Crunch Lab points to three deployments as evidence its method works. The first involves ADIA Lab, the research division of the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority. ADIA manages more than $900 billion in assets, making it one of the largest sovereign wealth funds in the world. The lab used CrunchDAO's network to improve predictions for asset pricing across different securities. The 17% accuracy gain translates to better portfolio decisions and risk management at scale.\\nThe second case involves the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, a research organization focused on genomics and biomedical science. The institute used the network for cancer gene research, applying computer vision techniques to analyze data. The press release describes the results as a \\\"breakthrough,\\\" though no specific metrics were disclosed. Cancer research involves identifying patterns in vast datasets, and machine learning models help researchers detect relationships that might otherwise go unnoticed.\\nThe third deployment is Mid+One, a pricing engine for foreign exchange over-the-counter (OTC) markets. OTC trades happen directly between parties, without exchanges, and pricing depends on real-time supply and demand. A global investment bank, which Crunch Lab did not name, now uses Mid+One in live trading. The engine relies on crowdsourced models to calculate mid-market prices, the midpoint between buy and sell quotes. Accurate pricing reduces transaction costs and improves execution for large trades.\\nWhy Investors See an Infrastructure Play\\nVenture capital in AI has tilted toward infrastructure in recent years. Investors pour money into platforms that enable other companies to build applications, rather than applications themselves. Crunch Lab fits this category. Will Nuelle, General Partner at Galaxy Ventures, said, \\\"Crunch Lab is building an intelligence layer for global enterprises. Whether predicting asset prices, optimizing energy demand, or advancing healthcare diagnostics, CrunchDAO's crowdsourced models unlock smarter, faster decision-making.\\\"\\nThomas Bailey of Road Capital echoed the sentiment: \\\"\\nWe believe Crunch Lab represents one of the most compelling attempts to connect global quants with enterprises at scale. AI is a trillion-dollar market, and open protocols like Crunch are positioned to capture it.\\\"\\nThe framing positions CrunchDAO as infrastructure, not a vertical solution. The platform could serve finance, healthcare, logistics, energy, or any field where predictive modeling drives value.\\nThe choice of investors also signals strategy. Galaxy Ventures operates as the venture arm of Galaxy Digital, a firm focused on digital assets and blockchain technology. Road Capital and Multicoin both invest in decentralized networks and crypto infrastructure. VanEck, known for exchange-traded funds, has expanded into digital assets. The investor group suggests Crunch Lab sees itself as part of the decentralized web, not traditional software-as-a-service.\\nRisks and Questions About Decentralized AI\\nThe concept raises questions. First, how does the platform ensure quality control when thousands of anonymous contributors submit models? CrunchDAO uses a performance-based reward system, so contributors earn tokens based on accuracy. But one bad model in a production environment can cause damage. Enterprises need guarantees, not probabilities.\\nSecond, data security remains a concern. Crunch Lab encrypts data before sharing it with contributors, but encryption methods vary in strength. Homomorphic encryption, which allows computation on encrypted data, is still developing and can be slow. Zero-knowledge proofs offer another path, but they add complexity. The company has not disclosed which methods it uses or how it audits security.\\nThird, the platform depends on network effects. With 10,000 contributors, CrunchDAO has enough participants to generate useful results. But maintaining engagement over time is difficult. Contributors need incentives to keep participating, and rewards must feel worthwhile. If the network shrinks, the quality of predictions could decline.\\nFourth, regulatory uncertainty looms over decentralized platforms. Enterprises in finance and healthcare operate under strict compliance rules. Using a decentralized network with anonymous contributors might conflict with Know Your Customer (KYC) or Anti-Money Laundering (AML) requirements. Crunch Lab will need to navigate these rules as it scales.\\nThe Path Forward for Collective Intelligence\\nCrunch Lab plans to expand beyond finance and biomedical research. The company did not specify which industries it will target next, but predictive modeling applies broadly. Energy companies forecast demand. Logistics firms optimize routes. Retailers predict inventory needs. Any organization that relies on forecasting could benefit from better models.\\nThe Solana Incubator selection adds credibility. Solana is one of the faster blockchains, processing thousands of transactions per second with low fees. Building on Solana allows CrunchDAO to handle high transaction volumes without cost prohibitions. The incubator provides technical support and connections to the Solana ecosystem, which could help with partnerships and integrations.\\nThe $5 million round will fund platform development and team expansion. Crunch Lab did not disclose current headcount or hiring plans, but scaling a decentralized network requires engineering resources. The company must build tools for enterprises to submit challenges, manage data encryption, coordinate contributors, aggregate predictions, and monitor performance. Each step involves technical complexity.\\nCompetitors exist in this space. Numerai, founded in 2015, operates a similar model for hedge fund predictions. Ocean Protocol builds data marketplaces with blockchain infrastructure. Fetch.ai focuses on autonomous agents for decentralized systems. Crunch Lab differentiates by emphasizing production deployments and measurable results, not just research or speculation.\\nFinal Thoughts\\nCrunch Lab's model offers a practical test of whether decentralized networks can deliver results that matter. The 17% accuracy improvement for ADIA Lab is measurable. The deployment of Mid+One in live trading is real. The Broad Institute breakthrough, while less quantified, comes from a respected research organization. These are not thought experiments or white papers. They are production systems handling consequential problems.\\nThe question is whether this approach scales across industries and use cases. Financial modeling and biomedical research are natural fits for crowdsourced AI. Both fields have large datasets, clear performance metrics, and tolerance for experimentation. But will the model work in manufacturing, where failures cause downtime? Or in autonomous vehicles, where mistakes endanger lives? Or in legal analysis, where accountability matters?\\nThe $10 million in funding gives Crunch Lab time to find answers. The investor group brings credibility and connections in decentralized infrastructure. The network of 10,000 contributors provides a foundation to build on. But the company must prove it can maintain quality, protect data, navigate regulations, and keep contributors engaged over time.\\nIf Crunch Lab succeeds, it could change how enterprises think about AI development. Instead of hoarding talent, organizations could tap into global networks. Instead of building models from scratch, they could access collective intelligence. The shift would redistribute value from centralized teams to decentralized contributors, and from proprietary systems to open protocols.\\nThat outcome depends on execution. Crunch Lab has results to point to, funding to deploy, and a network to leverage. Now it must scale without breaking what works.\\nDon\\u2019t forget to like and share the story!\\nThis author is an independent contributor publishing via our\"\n",

Recall OpenAI's ChatGPT Agent (formerly known as \\\"Operator\\\") and Anthropic's Computer Use, both released over the last two years.\\nNow, Google is getting into that same game as well. Today, the search giant's DeepMind AI lab subsidiary unveiled a new, fine-tuned and custom-trained version of its powerful Gemini 2.5 Pro LLM known as \\\"Gemini 2.5 Pro Computer Use,\\\" which can use a virtual browser to surf the web on your behalf, retrieve information, fill out forms, and even take actions on websites \\u2014 all from a user's single text prompt.\\n\\\"These are early days, but the model\\u2019s ability to interact with the web \\u2013 like scrolling, filling forms + navigating dropdowns \\u2013 is an important next step in building general-purpose agents,\\\" said Google CEO Sundar Pichai, as part of a longer statement on the social network, X.\\nThe model is not available for consumers directly from Google, though.\\nInstead, Google partnered with another company, Browserbase, founded by former Twilio engineer Paul Klein in early 2024, which offers virtual \\\"headless\\\" web browser specifically for use by AI agents and applications. (A \\\"headless\\\" browser is one that doesn't require a graphical user interface, or GUI, to navigate the web, though in this case and others, Browserbase does show a graphical representation for the user).\\nUsers can demo the new Gemini 2.5 Computer Use model directly on Browserbase here and even compare it side-by-side with the older, rival offerings from OpenAI and Anthropic in a new \\\"Browser Arena\\\" launched by the startup (though only one additional model can be selected alongside Gemini at a time).\\nFor AI builders and developers, it's being made as a raw, albeit propreitary LLM through the Gemini API in Google AI Studio for rapid prototyping, and Google Cloud's Vertex AI model selector and applications building platform.\\nThe new offering builds on the capabilities of Gemini 2.5 Pro, released back in March 2025 but which has been updated significantly several times since then, with a specific focus on enabling AI agents to perform direct interactions with user interfaces, including browsers and mobile applications.\\nOverall, it appears Gemini 2.5 Computer Use is designed to let developers create agents that can complete interface-driven tasks autonomously \\u2014 such as clicking, typing, scrolling, filling out forms, and navigating behind login screens.\\nRather than relying solely on APIs or structured inputs, this model allows AI systems to interact with software visually and functionally, much like a human would.\\nBrief User Hands-On Tests\\nIn my brief, unscientific initial hands-on tests on the Browserbase website, Gemini 2.5 Computer Use successfully navigate to Taylor Swift's official website as instructed and provided me a summary of what was being sold or promoted at the top \\u2014 a special edition of her newest album, \\\"The Life of A Showgirl.\\\"\\nIn another test, I asked Gemini 2.5 Computer Use to search Amazon for highly rated and well-reviewed solar lights I could stake into my back yard, and I was delighted to watch as it successfully completed a Google Search Captcha designed to weed out non-human users (\\\"Select all the boxes with a motorcycle.\\\") It did so in a matter of seconds.\\nHowever, once it got through there, it stalled and was unable to complete the task, despite serving up a \\\"task competed\\\" message.\\nI should also note here that while the ChatGPT agent from OpenAI and Anthropic's Claude can create and edit local files \\u2014 such as PowerPoint presentations, spreadsheets, or text documents \\u2014 on the user\\u2019s behalf, Gemini 2.5 Computer Use does not currently offer direct file system access or native file creation capabilities.\\nInstead, it is designed to control and navigate web and mobile user interfaces through actions like clicking, typing, and scrolling. Its output is limited to suggested UI actions or chatbot-style text responses; any structured output like a document or file must be handled separately by the developer, often through custom code or third-party integrations.\\nPerformance Benchmarks\\nGoogle says Gemini 2.5 Computer Use has demonstrated leading results in multiple interface control benchmarks, particularly when compared to other major AI systems including Claude Sonnet and OpenAI\\u2019s agent-based models.\\nEvaluations were conducted via Browserbase and Google\\u2019s own testing.\\nSome highlights include:\\nOnline-Mind2Web (Browserbase): 65.7% for Gemini 2.5 vs. 61.0% (Claude Sonnet 4) and 44.3% (OpenAI Agent)\\nWebVoyager (Browserbase): 79.9% for Gemini 2.5 vs. 69.4% (Claude Sonnet 4) and 61.0% (OpenAI Agent)\\nAndroidWorld (DeepMind): 69.7% for Gemini 2.5 vs. 62.1% (Claude Sonnet 4); OpenAI's model could not be measured due to lack of access\\nOSWorld: Currently not supported by Gemini 2.5; top competitor result was 61.4%\\nIn addition to strong accuracy, Google reports that the model operates at lower latency than other browser control solutions \\u2014 a key factor in production use cases like UI automation and testing.\\nHow It Works\\nAgents powered by the Computer Use model operate within an interaction loop. They receive:\\nA user task prompt\\nA screenshot of the interface\\nA history of past actions\\nThe model analyzes this input and produces a recommended UI action, such as clicking a button or typing into a field.\\nIf needed, it can request confirmation from the end user for riskier tasks, such as making a purchase.\\nOnce the action is executed, the interface state is updated and a new screenshot is sent back to the model. The loop continues until the task is completed or halted due to an error or a safety decision.\\nThe model uses a specialized tool called computer_use\\n, and it can be integrated into custom environments using tools like Playwright or via the Browserbase demo sandbox.\\nUse Cases and Adoption\\nAccording to Google, teams internally and externally have already started using the model across several domains:\\nGoogle\\u2019s payments platform team reports that Gemini 2.5 Computer Use successfully recovers over 60% of failed test executions, reducing a major source of engineering inefficiencies.\\nAutotab, a third-party AI agent platform, said the model outperformed others on complex data parsing tasks, boosting performance by up to 18% in their hardest evaluations.\\nPoke.com, a proactive AI assistant provider, noted that the Gemini model often operates 50% faster than competing solutions during interface interactions.\\nThe model is also being used in Google\\u2019s own product development efforts, including in Project Mariner, the Firebase Testing Agent, and AI Mode in Search.\\nSafety Measures\\nBecause this model directly controls software interfaces, Google emphasizes a multi-layered approach to safety:\\nA per-step safety service inspects every proposed action before execution.\\nDevelopers can define system-level instructions to block or require confirmation for specific actions.\\nThe model includes built-in safeguards to avoid actions that might compromise security or violate Google\\u2019s prohibited use policies.\\nFor example, if the model encounters a CAPTCHA, it will generate an action to click the checkbox but flag it as requiring user confirmation, ensuring the system does not proceed without human oversight.\\nTechnical Capabilities\\nThe model supports a wide array of built-in UI actions such as:\\nclick_at\\n,type_text_at\\n,scroll_document\\n,drag_and_drop\\n, and moreUser-defined functions can be added to extend its reach to mobile or custom environments\\nScreen coordinates are normalized (0\\u20131000 scale) and translated back to pixel dimensions during execution\\nIt accepts image and text input and outputs text responses or function calls to perform tasks. The recommended screen resolution for optimal results is 1440x900, though it can work with other sizes.\\nAPI Pricing Remains Almost Identical to Gemini 2.5 Pro\\nThe pricing for Gemini 2.5 Computer Use aligns closely with the standard Gemini 2.5 Pro model. Both follow the same per-token billing structure: input tokens are priced at $1.25 per one million tokens for prompts under 200,000 tokens, and $2.50 per million tokens for prompts longer than that.\\nOutput tokens follow a similar split, priced at $10.00 per million for smaller responses and $15.00 for larger ones.\\nWhere the models diverge is in availability and additional features.\\nGemini 2.5 Pro includes a free tier that allows developers to use the model at no cost, with no explicit token cap published, though usage may be subject to rate limits or quota constraints depending on the platform (e.g. Google AI Studio).\\nThis free access includes both input and output tokens. Once developers exceed their allotted quota or switch to the paid tier, standard per-token pricing applies.\\nIn contrast, Gemini 2.5 Computer Use is available exclusively through the paid tier. There is no free access currently offered for this model, and all usage incurs token-based charges from the outset.\\nFeature-wise, Gemini 2.5 Pro supports optional capabilities like context caching (starting at $0.31 per million tokens) and grounding with Google Search (free for up to 1,500 requests per day, then $35 per 1,000 additional requests). These are not available for Computer Use at this time.\\nAnother distinction is in data handling: output from the Computer Use model is not used to improve Google products in the paid tier, while free-tier usage of Gemini 2.5 Pro contributes to model improvement unless explicitly opted out.\\nOverall, developers can expect similar token-based costs across both models, but they should consider tier access, included capabilities, and data use policies when deciding which model fits their needs.\"\n",

Learn the secrets of blending human strategy with generative tools for truly professional, high-impact commercials.\\nAs a creative collaborator at a Warsaw-based video production company and a Gen AI nerd, I've spent the past year toying around with video generation tools\\u2014from Sora to Runway and, more recently, Veo-3.\\nAs you can guess, my life has been a whirlwind of prompts, pixels, and generative pandemonium.\\nAnyone who\\u2019s spent any time online has surely seen the hype: \\\"Create a Hollywood-level commercial for $5!\\\" or \\\"Fire your video team, AI is here!\\\"\\nIt\\u2019s a compelling narrative, but as someone deep in the trenches creating AI-driven ads for actual, paying clients, I\\u2019m here to tell you the reality is a lot more nuanced, a bit messier, and infinitely more intriguing.\\nThe truth is, commercial-ready AI video tools are absolutely here. They can slash production costs, deliver stunning visuals, and open up creative avenues we could only dream of a few years ago. But\\u2014and this is a big BUT\\u2014they are not magic wands.\\nUsing Gen AI video platforms effectively is more like conducting a very strange, very technical orchestra than it is about pushing a button. Understanding how to amplify the power of AI with a solid foundation of traditional, human-led creative strategy is just as important as knowing which AI to use.\\nThe Great AI Gold Rush: Hype vs. Reality in Video Marketing\\nLet's start with the numbers, because they're pretty wild.\\nVideo is already king in marketing\\u2014in 2025, a staggering\\nNow, inject generative AI into that equation. Suddenly, the barriers to entry\\u2014cost and time\\u2014seem to be evaporating. When used cleverly, AI\\nBut here's where the hype train can go off the rails.\\nMany marketers are diving in, with over half expecting AI-generated content to outperform human-made content. Yet, many quickly discover that the shiny \\\"text-to-video\\\" demo doesn't quite translate to a commercial that actually sells a product.\\nThe output often looks\\u2026 well, AI-generated. Characters have inconsistent faces, the lighting is just a little bit off, and the whole thing lacks a soul. This is the gap where professional experience becomes not just valuable but essential.\\nPre-Production: The Most Important Part of Creating an AI Video Has Nothing to Do with Artificial Intelligence\\nThis may seem counterintuitive, but the success of an AI-generated ad is almost completely determined before you write a single prompt.\\nYou can't just tell an AI, \\\"Make me a cool ad for yogurt,\\\" and expect a masterpiece. You have to do the human work first. This is where I spend the majority of my time on any given project.\\nSuppose you generate AI videos for a living.\\nA client\\u2014say, a dairy company\\u2014approaches you to promote their new sugar-free yogurt. They want a 30-second ad that feels fresh, healthy, and premium.\\nMy process starts with a deep dive into creative strategy.\\nWhat's the core message? Who is the target audience? What feeling do we want to evoke? I brainstorm several concepts.\\nMaybe one concept is a bright, sun-drenched kitchen scene. Another could be a more abstract, artistic take with flowing milk and fresh fruit. If your client is brave enough, you could take it a step further by creating a cyberpunk fantasy complete with robot cows and acid milk\\u2014and introducing the promoted 100% natural yogurt as a welcome alternative to artificial, chemically altered dairy.\\nI tend to write a script for each promising concept, focusing on a narrative that could potentially resonate with the client. And once they choose a creative direction, I move on to the mood board.\\nThis is the visual North Star. I gather images that define the lighting (soft morning light), the color palette (clean whites, vibrant berry tones), and the overall aesthetic. This isn't just for me; it's for the AI.\\nNext, I create a frame-by-frame storyboard. This is the blueprint for the entire ad. But for AI, I go one step further: generating keyframes. These are high-quality, static images for the most crucial moments in the ad, created with tools like Midjourney. I perfect the look of the yogurt cup, the texture of the fruit, the expression on a person's face. This painstaking process is the only way to ensure the AI maintains visual consistency. Without it, the yogurt cup might magically change its label design halfway through the ad.\\nThe Art of Wielding Chaos: A Tale of Two Ads\\nOnce you have a rock-solid plan, it's time to get down to actual\\nCase Study 1: The Yogurt Dream\\nFor the dairy client, with the storyboard and keyframes in hand, I turn to models like Runway and Veo-3. The process is iterative. I don\\u2019t just generate a 30-second clip. I generate dozens of short, 3-5 second clips for each shot in the storyboard. For a shot of a spoon dipping into the yogurt, I might run the prompt ten times, tweaking it slightly to get the perfect motion and texture.\\nI constantly refer back to the keyframes, using them as image prompts to guide the AI: \\\"Animate this image of a strawberry falling into yogurt in a slow-motion, cinematic style.\\\"\\nI wrestle with the AI to maintain consistency.\\nSometimes the lighting shifts unexpectedly. Sometimes the physics of the milk splash looks just plain wrong. It\\u2019s a constant cycle of generating, reviewing, and refining. This is the \\\"engineering\\\" part of prompt engineering, and it takes hours of patient, detail-oriented work. Fortunately, ChatGPT and Gemini can help alleviate some of the prompting burden, but even those know-it-alls don't always get the instructions right, let alone on the first try.\\nCase Study 2: How a Turquoise Banana Saved an Ad Campaign\\nNow for a wilder story.\\nI had a client in the adult eCommerce space who needed a 30-second ad for a personal wellness device. As you can imagine, generative AI models are, to put it mildly, prudish. Any prompt even hinting at the product was met with a polite but firm \\\"I can't generate that.\\\"\\nThis is where creative problem-solving becomes your most valuable asset. I knew I couldn't show the product. So, I decided to show its effect.\\nMy concept was built around a universally relatable hero: an exhausted young mother juggling remote work, a crying baby, and a barking dog. Her moment of escape is in the bathroom with her new \\\"personal assistant.\\\" But what could be used as a visual stand-in? The brainstorming session was hilarious. I finally landed on the perfect, surreal substitute: a vibrant, turquoise banana. It was funny, completely unexpected, and 100% safe for any algorithm.\\nThe execution was a hybrid masterpiece.\\nI used Midjourney and Sora to generate keyframes of the hero and her absurdly colored fruit, locking in the visual style. Then, I turned to Runway to animate the scenes. The ad culminates with the hero locking the bathroom door, followed by a cartoonish, house-shaking blast of energy rippling through the home.\\nThe final ad was witty, memorable, and navigated the AI's content filters perfectly. It showed that with a dose of human ingenuity, you can guide AI to tackle even the most sensitive briefs with style and humor.\\nThe Final Polish: Where the Real Magic Happens\\nHere's the biggest secret of AI video production: the raw footage the AI spits out is almost never the final product. It's the raw clay, not the finished sculpture. This is where a background in traditional filmmaking isn't just helpful; it's a necessity.\\nThe dozens of short clips generated for the yogurt ad have to be meticulously assembled. A skilled editor sequences them to match the storyboard's pacing and narrative flow.\\nThen comes color grading. Even with a super-detailed prompt, you may get AI-generated clips that have slight variations in color. A professional colorist unifies them into a cohesive, cinematic look that matches the brand's palette.\\nSound design is just as important. You must include the subtle clink of the spoon, the splash of fresh fruit in the yogurt, and a licensed music track to enhance the mood. Various tools can be used for this, including Veo's built-in capabilities and dedicated sound design platforms such as ElevenLabs.\\nFinally, the company's logo and any on-screen text are integrated. This post-production phase can take just as long, if not longer, than the generation phase, and it\\u2019s what elevates the content from a cool tech demo to a polished, professional advertisement that builds brand trust. After all, stats show that\\nSo, Is It Really Cheaper?\\nYes, but it's not \\\"cheap.\\\"\\nA traditional 30-second commercial with a live-action shoot can easily run into the tens of thousands of dollars for crew, locations, actors, and equipment. The\\ncost of an AI-generated video ad of similar quality, like my turquoise banana project, might range between $1,000 and $5,000. That's a massive reduction.\\nHowever, the cost doesn't disappear completely; it shifts. Instead of paying for a large film crew and physical logistics, the client is investing in highly skilled human talent: creative strategists who can develop a winning concept, prompt engineers who can translate that vision for the AI, and professional editors who can turn the raw output into a polished final product. The investment moves from hardware and location fees to brainpower and expertise. For SMBs, this is fantastic news. It means a smaller budget can now compete on a much higher level, achieving a cinematic quality that was previously out of reach.\\nAI Is Not a Videographer\\u2019s Replacement\\u2014It\\u2019s Their New Creative Partner\\nThe takeaway here isn't to be skeptical of AI but to be realistic.\\nAI video generation isn't a replacement for creative professionals; it's an unbelievably powerful tool for creative professionals.\\nThe technology automates the tedious, opens up new visual possibilities, and democratizes access to high-quality video. According to a\\nThe best results, however, will always come from a hybrid approach\\u2014where a smart, experienced human is guiding the AI with a clear creative vision.\"\n",

We observe a person\\u2019s clothing, body language, confidence, and even how they speak then guide them toward choices that seem to fit their style or needs. All these are features about a person. We analyze them deduct a budget and style they will be interested in.\\nBut can a machine leaning algo do the same ? Yes, it can. In the above example, the shopkeeper was trying to find if he has seen another individual like me and deduce my wants. We have a similar algorithm. K nearest neighbor. The basic idea behind K-Nearest Neighbors, a simple yet powerful machine learning algorithm that makes predictions based on the behavior of \\\"nearby\\\" data points. Instead of learning complex patterns or weights like other algorithms, KNN looks at the K most similar data points (its \\\"neighbors\\\") and lets them vote to decide the outcome.\\nTL;DR\\nCan Your Demographics Reveal Your Paycheck?\\nEthical Implications: Bias, Fairness & Inequality\\nWhile using demographic data can improve personalization and predictions, it also raises serious ethical concerns that must be addressed.\\nBias in Data\\nJust like human judgment, machine learning can be biased. For example, a shop assistant who regularly sees a certain type of customer may begin to make assumptions based on past patterns, assumptions that may not apply in a different location or context.\\nThis is exactly what happens in machine learning when models are trained on biased datasets: they inherit patterns that may not generalize well, leading to systematic errors or misinformed decisions.\\nFairness\\nMachine learning models can produce unfair outcomes, often unintentionally. We've seen real-world examples from biased hiring tools to facial recognition systems criticized for unfair treatment of certain groups.\\nThese outcomes can negatively impact individuals, communities, and society at large.\\nInequality\\nWhen predictions are linked to pricing or access, they can reinforce existing inequalities. For instance, if a system predicts someone's willingness to pay based on their profile, it might show higher prices to some users creating an unfair experience.\\nTake Uber\\u2019s surge pricing as an example: while it helps motivate drivers during high-demand times (e.g., during rain or rush hour), it can feel exploitative to riders who have no other choice.\\nAs an example, we can look at\\n- Origin: UCI Machine Learning Repository\\n- Size: 48,842 instances, 14 attributes\\n- Ethics: The dataset is publicly available for research and educational purposes.\\nIt contains anonymized census data, and its use complies with ethical standards for open data. The Adult dataset contains demographic information and income labels.\\nObjective\\nThe main objective is to predict whether a person earns more than $50K\\/year based on attributes such as age, education, occupation, and hours worked per week.\\nAlgorithm to the solution\\nk-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm: kNN is a non-parametric, instance-based learning algorithm used for classification and regression. We can use it for classification as well but we will use to predict income based on the attributes at hand.\\nEuclidean distance\\nThe most common way to measure the distance between two points in space.\\nA \\\"straight-line\\\" distance between two points.

The company that brought generative AI to the mainstream with a simple chatbot is now building the foundations for its next act: a comprehensive computing platform designed to move beyond the screen and browser, with legendary designer Jony Ive enlisted to help shape its physical form.\\nAt its third annual DevDay, OpenAI unveiled a suite of tools that signals a strategic pivot from a model provider to a full-fledged ecosystem. The message was clear: the era of simply asking an AI questions is over. The future is about commanding AI to perform complex tasks, build software autonomously, and live inside every application, a transition Altman framed as moving from \\\"systems that you can ask anything to, to systems that you can ask to do anything for you.\\\"\\nThe day\\u2019s announcements were a three-pronged assault on the status quo, targeting how users interact with software, how developers build it, and how businesses deploy intelligent agents. But it was the sessions held behind closed doors, away from the public livestream, that revealed the true scope of OpenAI\\u2019s ambition \\u2014 a future that includes new hardware, a relentless pursuit of computational power, and a philosophical quest to redefine our relationship with technology.\\nFrom chatbot to operating system: The new 'App Store'\\nThe centerpiece of the public-facing keynote was the transformation of ChatGPT itself. With the new Apps SDK, OpenAI is turning its wildly popular chatbot into a dynamic, interactive platform, effectively an operating system where developers can build and distribute their own applications.\\n\\u201cToday, we're going to open up ChatGPT for developers to build real apps inside of ChatGPT,\\u201d Altman announced during the keynote presentation to applause. \\u201cThis will enable a new generation of apps that are interactive, adaptive and personalized, that you can chat with.\\u201d\\nLive demonstrations showcased apps from partners like Coursera, Canva, and Zillow running seamlessly within a chat conversation. A user could watch a machine learning lecture, ask ChatGPT to explain a concept in real-time, and then use Canva to generate a poster based on the conversation, all without leaving the chat interface. The apps can render rich, interactive UIs, even going full-screen to offer a complete experience, like exploring a Zillow map of homes.\\nFor developers, this represents a powerful new distribution channel. \\u201cWhen you build with the Apps SDK, your apps can reach hundreds of millions of chat users,\\u201d Altman said, highlighting a direct path to a massive user base that has grown to over 800 million weekly active users.\\nIn a private press conference later, Nick Turley, head of ChatGPT, elaborated on the grander vision. \\\"We never meant to build a chatbot,\\\" he stated. \\\"When we set out to make ChatGPT, we meant to build a super assistant and we got a little sidetracked. And one of the tragedies of getting a little sidetracked is that we built a great chatbot, but we are the first ones to say that not all software needs to be a chatbot, not all interaction with the commercial world needs to be a chatbot.\\\"\\nTurley emphasized that while OpenAI is excited about natural language interfaces, \\\"the interface really needs to evolve, which is why you see so much UI in the demos today. In fact, you can even go full screen and chat is in the background.\\\" He described a future where users might \\\"start your day in ChatGPT, just because it kind of has become the de facto entry point into the commercial web and into a lot of software,\\\" but clarified that \\\"our incentive is not to keep you in. Our product is to allow other people to build amazing businesses on top and to evolve the form factor of software.\\\"\\nThe rise of the agents: Building the 'do anything' AI\\nIf apps are about bringing the world into ChatGPT, the new \\\"Agent Kit\\\" is about sending AI out into the world to get things done. OpenAI is providing a complete \\\"set of building blocks... to help you take agents from prototype to production,\\\" Altman explained in his keynote.\\nAgent Kit is an integrated development environment for creating autonomous AI workers. It features a visual canvas to design complex workflows, an embeddable chat interface (\\\"Chat Kit\\\") for deploying agents in any app, and a sophisticated evaluation suite to measure and improve performance.\\nA compelling demo from financial operations platform Ramp showed how Agent Kit was used to build a procurement agent. An employee could simply type, \\\"I need five more ChatGPT business seats,\\\" and the agent would parse the request, check it against company expense policies, find vendor details, and prepare a virtual credit card for the purchase \\u2014 a process that once took weeks now completed in minutes.\\nThis push into agents is a direct response to a growing enterprise need to move beyond AI as a simple information retrieval tool and toward AI as a productivity engine that automates complex business processes. Brad Lightcap, OpenAI's COO, noted that for enterprise adoption, \\\"you needed this kind of shift to more agentic AI that could actually do things for you, versus just respond with text outputs.\\\"\\nThe future of code and the Jony Ive bBombshell\\nPerhaps the most profound shift is occurring in software development itself. Codex, OpenAI's AI coding agent, has graduated from a research preview to a full-fledged product, now powered by a specialized version of the new GPT-5 model. It is, as one speaker put it, \\\"a teammate that understands your context.\\\"\\nThe capabilities are staggering. Developers can now assign Codex tasks directly from Slack, and the agent can autonomously write code, create pull requests, and even review other engineers' work on GitHub. A live demo showed Codex taking a simple photo of a whiteboard sketch and turning it into a fully functional, beautifully designed mobile app screen. Another demo showed an app that could \\\"self-evolve,\\\" reprogramming itself in real-time based on a user's natural language request.\\nBut the day's biggest surprise came in a closing fireside chat, which was not livestreamed, between Altman and Jony Ive, the iconic former chief design officer of Apple. The two revealed they have been collaborating for three years on a new family of AI-centric hardware.\\nIve, whose design philosophy shaped the iPhone, iMac, and Apple Watch, said his creative team\\u2019s purpose \\\"became clear\\\" with the launch of ChatGPT. He argued that our current relationship with technology is broken and that AI presents an opportunity for a fundamental reset.\\n\\u201cI think it would be absurd to assume that you could have technology that is this breathtaking, delivered to us through legacy products, products that are decades old,\\u201d Ive said. \\u201cI see it as a chance to use this most remarkable capability to full-on address a lot of the overwhelm and despair that people feel right now.\\u201d\\nWhile details of the devices remain secret, Ive spoke of his motivation in deeply human terms. \\u201cWe love our species, and we want to be useful. We think that humanity deserves much better than humanity generally is given,\\u201d he said. He emphasized the importance of \\\"care\\\" in the design process, stating, \\\"We sense when people have cared... you sense carelessness. You sense when somebody does not care about you, they care about money and schedule.\\\"\\nThis collaboration confirms that OpenAI's ambitions are not confined to the cloud; it is actively exploring the physical interface through which humanity will interact with its powerful new intelligence.\\nThe Unquenchable Thirst for Compute\\nUnderpinning this entire platform strategy is a single, overwhelming constraint: the availability of computing power. In both the private press conference and the un-streamed Developer State of the Union, OpenAI\\u2019s leadership returned to this theme again and again.\\n\\u201cThe degree to which we are all constrained by compute... Everyone is just so constrained on being able to offer the services at the scale required to get the revenue that at this point, we're quite confident we can push it pretty far,\\u201d Altman told reporters. He added that even with massive new hardware partnerships with AMD and others, \\\"we'll be saying the same thing again. We're so convinced... There's so much more demand.\\\"\\nThis explains the company\\u2019s aggressive, multi-billion-dollar investment in infrastructure. When asked about profitability, Altman was candid that the company is in a phase of \\\"investment and growth.\\\" He invoked a famous quote from Walt Disney, paraphrasing, \\\"We make more money so we can make more movies.\\\" For OpenAI, the \\\"movies\\\" are ever-more-powerful AI models.\\nGreg Brockman, OpenAI\\u2019s President, put the ultimate goal in stark economic terms during the Developer State of the Union. \\\"AI is going to become, probably in the not too distant future, the fundamental driver of economic growth,\\\" he said. \\\"Asking \\u2018How much compute do you want?\\u2019 is a little bit like asking how much workforce do you want? The answer is, you can always get more out of more.\\\"\\nAs the day concluded and developers mingled at the reception, the scale of OpenAI's project came into focus. Fueled by new models like the powerful GPT-5 Pro and the stunning Sora 2 video generator, the company is no longer just building AI. It is building the world where AI will live \\u2014 a world of intelligent apps, autonomous agents, and new physical devices, betting that in the near future, intelligence itself will be the ultimate platform.\"\n",

The new offerings are designed to help customers transition from experimentation to scalable deployment, said Bruno Aziza, IBM\\u2019s vice president of data, AI, and analytics strategy.\\n\\u201cCustomers are struggling to get value from their investment,\\u201d he said. More than 300 customer sessions at the event exhibit deployments of agentic systems in production.\\nHybrid AI\\nAziza said IBM\\u2019s vision differs from competitors by emphasizing interoperability and hybrid operations. \\u201cWhat makes our approach different is that while everyone is providing a siloed, vertically integrated solution for building agents, we think about how all these agents that have been built across multiple platforms are going to be orchestrated and operated at scale,\\u201d he said.\\nHeadlining the slate of IBM\\u2019s AI announcements are new features for watsonx Orchestrate, a platform encompassing more than 500 tools and customizable, domain-specific agents from IBM and its partners. Designed to be tool-agnostic and adaptable to any environment, Orchestrate is meant to enable scalable deployment and governance of AI agents. New capabilities include AgentOps, a governance and observability layer that provides lifecycle monitoring and policy-based control for AI agents in production. IBM said the tool makes agent behavior more transparent and secure through real-time monitoring.\\nAziza said AgentOps extends IBM\\u2019s orchestration framework by enabling customers to consistently test and govern agents. \\u201cYou can get real-time monitoring and policy-based controls so you can not only build and orchestrate these agents, but also run them in production,\\u201d he said.\\nTo simplify development, IBM is introducing Agentic Workflows, which enable teams to reuse and scale multi-agent processes, as well as integraton with Langflow, a drag-and-drop visual application builder. The company said the enhancements help both developers and business users build and deploy agents quickly.\\nMainframe agents\\nSix months after announcing its latest generation of mainframes, the watsonx Assistant is bringing agentic capabilities to the Z platform. The goal is to make AI accessible across all mainframe users, from system administrators to developers, said Tina Tarquinio, chief product officer for IBM Z and LinuxONE, the Linux-based version of Z.\\nThe new version of Watsonx Assistant for Z moves \\u201cfrom question and answer to question and action,\\u201d she said, enabling agents to perform multi-step workflows, maintain conversational context, and make informed decisions.\\nThe platform features an agent builder with a low-code interface, enabling users to design custom agents tailored to specific enterprise processes. \\u201cIt can evaluate tradeoffs and understand the pros and cons of any action,\\u201d Tarquinio said, adding that the framework delivers the security, compliance and scalability features that are central to regulated industries.\\nIBM also announced the general availability of the IBM Spire Accelerator, a purpose-built AI processor for mainframe and LinuxONE systems that debuted in April. Designed as a collaborative effort between IBM Research and IBM Infrastructure, Spire supports generative and agentic AI workloads with low latency and power consumption. An IBM Z17 can house up to 48 Spire cards, each equipped with 32 cores and drawing about 75 watts of power.\\nUnified knowledge graph\\nIn the first major product announcement to emerge from IBM\\u2019s $6.4 billion acquisition of HashiCorp in February, IBM introduced Project infragraph, a new capability within the HashiCorp Cloud Platform that provides a real-time knowledge graph for enterprise infrastructure observability. It\\u2019s \\u201ca unified knowledge graph for infrastructure, connecting application workloads with their related components and preparing enterprises for their AI-driven automation,\\u201d said Kyle Ruddy, senior director of product marketing at HashiCorp.\\nRuddy said the offering is aimed at organizations struggling with fragmented tooling and reactive operations. \\u201cCloud estates are larger and more distributed than ever, making it impossible for teams to maintain visibility with traditional tools,\\u201d he said. \\u201cProject infragraph collapses that timeline to minutes,\\u201d he said.\\nThe new platform ingests data from cloud providers, Kubernetes clusters, and self-hosted environments to create a live relational view of dependencies across services. It integrates with ServiceNow\\u2019s digital workflow platform and security tools from Palo Alto Networks Inc. and Wiz Inc., Future plans are to connect to IBM\\u2019s Red Hat Ansible, OpenShift, watsonx Orchestrate, Concert, Turbonomic and Cloudability products.\\n\\u201cProject infragraph is more than just a new capability; it\\u2019s a foundation for managing infrastructure in the AI era,\\u201d Ruddy said. The product is currently in beta test and no availability date has been announced.\\nQuantum cryptography\\nAlso new is Guardian Cryptography Manager, a platform designed to help enterprises manage cryptographic keys, certificates and algorithms across complex hybrid environments. The product addresses the growing challenge of cryptographic sprawl and the coming shift to quantum-safe algorithms.\\n\\u201cOnly 45% of organizations say that they have full visibility into their cryptographic estate,\\u201d said Vishal Kamat, vice president of data security at IBM. \\u201cMost companies today manage certificates on a spreadsheet, and that\\u2019s just not scalable.\\u201d\\nThe new platform provides automated discovery, risk assessment and lifecycle management of cryptographic assets to support \\u201ccrypto agility,\\u201d or the ability to update encryption methods without disrupting operations.\\nKamat noted that regulations are tightening. The frequency with which companies will need to update their certificates is expected to drop from the current 398 days to just 47 days by 2029. Quantum computers are also expected to render most current cryptographic algorithms obsolete. Enterprises need automation to keep up, Kamat said.\\nSoftware development assistant\\nFor software developers, IBM is previewing Project Bob an AI-based tool system with task generation capabilities for enterprise software development lifecycles.\\nIBM said Project Bob goes beyond AI coding assistants to work alongside developers to write, test, upgrade and secure software. It works with the Claude, Mistral, Llama and IBM Granite large language models.\\nFeatures include support for the Java, JavaScript\\/TypeScript, Python, RPG, Go, C#, Rust, PHP and Kotlin programming languages; automated upgrades to Java code, framework migrations and multistep refactoring across large codebases. Project Bob can coordinate coding, testing and remediation tasks while preserving context across sessions. Security features include \\u201cshift-left\\u201d vulnerability scanning, accelerated FedRAMP hardening and migration to quantum-safe cryptography.\\nFinally, IBM and Anthropic PBC said they have formed a strategic partnership to advance enterprise-ready AI by integrating Anthropic\\u2019s Claude LLMs into IBM\\u2019s software portfolio. The first integration is within IBM\\u2019s new AI-first integrated environment for enterprise software development and modernization. Currently in private preview, the IDE is being used by more than 6,000 IBM early adopters, who report average productivity gains of 45% without compromising code quality or security, IBM said.\\nThe partnership reflects growing enterprise demand for AI solutions that can move seamlessly from experimentation to production. By combining Claude\\u2019s generative AI capabilities with IBM\\u2019s strengths in hybrid cloud, enterprise software delivery and regulated industry compliance, the companies hope to accelerate secure AI deployment in large-scale IT environments.\\nImage: IBM\\nA message from John Furrier, co-founder of SiliconANGLE:\\nSupport our mission to keep content open and free by engaging with theCUBE community.

Docker Offload addresses this constraint by extending local development workflows to scalable, GPU-enabled cloud resources \\u2014 all without leaving local development experience.\\nWhat is Docker Offload?\\nDocker Offload is a fully managed service that lets users execute Docker builds and run containers on the cloud infrastructure while not losing the local development experience. This drastically reduces the load on your local machine. It seems like magic behind the scenes as you will continue to run the same Docker commands with which you are familiar. However, Docker Desktop creates a secure SSH tunnel to a Docker daemon running in the cloud. It provides a local experience, even though the containers are created and workloads executed on the cloud infrastructure. Some of the key features include:\\n- Cloud-Based Builds: Offload complex container builds to high-performance, managed cloud runners.\\n- GPU Acceleration: Instantly access hardware needed for AI\\/ML pipelines without manual setup.\\n- Hybrid Workflows: Seamlessly transition between local and cloud execution with Docker Desktop or the CLI.\\n- VDI Compatibility: Supports environments like virtual desktops and machines without native virtualization support.\\n- Secure Communication: All traffic is secured, and ephemeral cloud environments are automatically cleaned up post-use.\\nWhy use Docker Offload?\\n- Run containers that are compute-intensive and require more resources than your local machine\\n- Leverage cloud infrastructure for offloading heavy builds\\n- Ideal for high-velocity development workflows that need the flexibility of the cloud without sacrificing local development experience\\n- Instant access to GPU-powered environments\\n- Accelerate both development and testing without worrying about cloud infrastructure setup\\n- Develop efficiently in restricted environments like VDIs\\nUsage Model and Pricing\\nDevelopers receive 300 free GPU minutes during the beta. Afterward, usage is billed at $0.015 per GPU minute (subject to change post-beta). Sessions are ephemeral \\u2014 resources are freed automatically after inactivity to optimize both cost and security.\\nConsiderations\\n- Security: All remote sessions use encrypted tunnels. No data is retained after session termination, supporting both security and privacy best practices.\\n- Platform Neutrality: Docker Offload is vendor-agnostic and integrates with multiple cloud providers, ensuring a non-lock-in approach for practitioners.\\n- Community and Ecosystem: Docker Offload enhances existing workflows for AI, agentic application development and collaborative cloud-native projects, emphasizing standardization and compatibility with emerging AI orchestration frameworks.\\nHow to Get Started?\\nPrerequisites:\\n- Docker Desktop 4.43.0 version or above\\n- Docker Hub Account with Docker Offload access\\n- Docker Offload is currently in beta, so you\\u2019ll need to sign up for access. Visit here to sign up for beta access.\\n- You will receive an email after which you can enable Docker Offload in your Docker Desktop.\\n- No restrictive proxy or firewall blocking traffic to Docker Cloud\\nHow to Start Docker Offload\\nOnce you receive access, you can enable Docker Offload in two ways: Either using Docker Desktop or via Terminal.\\nStart via Docker Desktop\\nIn the screenshot below, you can see a Toggle button at the top to enable Docker Offload.\\nAs soon as you do that, Docket Desktop color will change to purple and you\\u2019ll see a cloud icon in the header \\u2014 which means that Docker Desktop is now securely connected to the cloud environment that mimics your local experience. Now, when you run builds or containers, they execute remotely but as a user you will not see any difference.\\nStart via Terminal\\nOpen terminal and execute\\ndocker offload start\\nThe command will display a prompt, as shown in the image below, allowing you to choose the account you wish to use for Docker Offload.\\nIn the next prompt, it will ask whether you need GPU support.\\nOnce you select the options, it will display \\u2018New docker context created: docker-cloud\\u2019 message and the color of the Docker Desktop is changed to purple.\\nHow to Run a Container With Docker Offload\\nBefore running a container, make sure to verify Docker Offload is running properly. Execute the command below in the terminal to check the status.\\ndocker offload status\\nYou can also see a cloud icon with Offload + GPU running at the bottom left on your Docker Desktop window.\\nTo get more information about Docker Offload status, run the command below which gives more details about daemon and status and if there were any failed reasons while running Docker Offload, as shown in the below screenshot.\\ndocker offload diagnose\\nHow to Build a Container With Docker Offload\\nFor this article, I have forked a Docker Offload demo app from Docker GitHub Repo.\\ngit clone https:\\/\\/github.com\\/sunnynagavo\\/docker-offload-demo.git\\ncd .\\\\docker-offload-demo\\\\\\nOnce you are inside the folder, run the Docker Build command as shown below. The build will take place on cloud infrastructure rather than your local machine, which you can observe in the logs, as shown in the screenshot below.\\nYou can also click on the Build tab on Docker Desktop to see the details of the build you just ran.\\nTo run the application with GPUs, execute the below command in the terminal.\\ndocker run \\u2013rm \\u2013gpus all -p 3000:3000 docker-offload-demo\\nYou can see the output in the logs where it leveraged GPU (NVIDIA L4 by default) on the Docker cloud.\\nNavigate to the URL http:\\/\\/localhost:3000 to see the demo application as shown in the below screenshot.\\nThe demo application shows a comprehensive view of your system\\u2019s performance by providing confirmation that you are utilizing Docker Offload. The app clearly shows the stats about what GPU hardware (NVIDIA L4) is used in running along with resources used in running the application.\\nHow to Stop Docker Offload\\nJust like starting Docker Offload, there are two ways to stop Docker Offload.\\nStop via Docker Desktop\\nYou can use the same toggle button at the top to stop Docker Offload and color changes back to your original theme.\\nStop via Terminal\\nOpen Terminal and execute the below command to stop Docker Offload.\\ndocker offload stop\\nOnce it\\u2019s stopped, all the previously built images and containers will be cleaned. By running the above commands, you will now be able to build images and run containers locally.\\nConclusion\\nDocker offload closes the gap between ease of local development and the power of cloud scalability. It helps developers to run compute-intensive workloads in the cloud without losing the experience of working locally. Docker Offload is like adding a supercomputer brain to your local machine. I highly encourage developers to experience the power of Docker Offload. So, what are you waiting for? Go ahead and submit your request for access to Docker Offload.\\nFor more details, check out Docker official documentation on Docker Offload.\"\n",

Meet AUI's Apollo-1 | VentureBeat\\nSocial card title: Has this startup finally cracked the code on enterprise AI agent reliability? Meet AUI's Apollo-1\\nFor more than a decade, conversational AI has promised human-like assistants that can do more than chat. Yet even as large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude learn to reason, explain, and code, one critical category of interaction remains largely unsolved \\u2014 reliably completing tasks for people outside of chat.\\nEven the best AI models score only in the 30th percentile on Terminal-Bench Hard, a third-party benchmark designed to evaluate the performance of AI agents on completing a variety of browser-based tasks, far below the reliability demanded by most enterprises and users. And task-specific benchmarks like TAU-Bench airline, which measures the reliability of AI agents on finding and booking flights on behalf of a user, also don't have much higher pass rates, with only 56% for the top performing agents and models (Claude 3.7 Sonnet) \\u2014 meaning the agent fails nearly half the time.\\nNew York City-based Augmented Intelligence (AUI) Inc., co-founded by Ohad Elhelo and Ori Cohen, believes it has finally come with a solution to boost AI agent reliability to a level where most enterprises can trust they will do as instructed, reliably.\\nThe company\\u2019s new foundation model, called Apollo-1 \\u2014 which remains in preview with early testers now but is close to an impending general release \\u2014 is built on a principle it calls stateful neuro-symbolic reasoning.\\nIt's a hybrid architecture championed by even LLM skeptics like Gary Marcus, designed to guarantee consistent, policy-compliant outcomes in every customer interaction.\\n\\u201cConversational AI is essentially two halves,\\u201d said Elhelo in a recent interview with VentureBeat. \\u201cThe first half \\u2014 open-ended dialogue \\u2014 is handled beautifully by LLMs. They\\u2019re designed for creative or exploratory use cases. The other half is task-oriented dialogue, where there\\u2019s always a specific goal behind the conversation. That half has remained unsolved because it requires certainty.\\u201d\\nAUI defines certainty as the difference between an agent that \\u201cprobably\\u201d performs a task and one that almost \\u201calways\\u201d does.\\nFor example, on TAU-Bench Airline, it performs at a staggering 92.5% pass rate, leaving all the other current competitors far behind in the dust \\u2014 according to benchmarks shared with VentureBeat and posted on AUI's website.\\nElhelo offered simple examples: a bank that must enforce ID verification for refunds over $200, or an airline that must always offer a business-class upgrade before economy.\\n\\u201cThose aren\\u2019t preferences,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThey\\u2019re requirements. And no purely generative approach can deliver that kind of behavioral certainty.\\u201d\\nAUI and its work on improving reliability was previously covered by subscription news outlet The Information, but has not received widespread coverage in publicly accessible media \\u2014 until now.\\nFrom Pattern Matching to Predictable Action\\nThe team argues that transformer models, by design, can\\u2019t meet that bar. Large language models generate plausible text, not guaranteed behavior. \\u201cWhen you tell an LLM to always offer insurance before payment, it might \\u2014 usually,\\u201d Elhelo said. \\u201cConfigure Apollo-1 with that rule, and it will \\u2014 every time.\\u201d\\nThat distinction, he said, stems from the architecture itself. Transformers predict the next token in a sequence. Apollo-1, by contrast, predicts the next action in a conversation, operating on what AUI calls a typed symbolic state.\\nCohen explained the idea in more technical terms. \\u201cNeuro-symbolic means we\\u2019re merging the two dominant paradigms,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThe symbolic layer gives you structure \\u2014 it knows what an intent, an entity, and a parameter are \\u2014 while the neural layer gives you language fluency. The neuro-symbolic reasoner sits between them. It\\u2019s a different kind of brain for dialogue.\\u201d\\nWhere transformers treat every output as text generation, Apollo-1 runs a closed reasoning loop: an encoder translates natural language into a symbolic state, a state machine maintains that state, a decision engine determines the next action, a planner executes it, and a decoder turns the result back into language. \\u201cThe process is iterative,\\u201d Cohen said. \\u201cIt loops until the task is done. That\\u2019s how you get determinism instead of probability.\\u201d\\nA Foundation Model for Task Execution\\nUnlike traditional chatbots or bespoke automation systems, Apollo-1 is meant to serve as a foundation model for task-oriented dialogue \\u2014 a single, domain-agnostic system that can be configured for banking, travel, retail, or insurance through what AUI calls a System Prompt.\\n\\u201cThe System Prompt isn\\u2019t a configuration file,\\u201d Elhelo said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a behavioral contract. You define exactly how your agent must behave in situations of interest, and Apollo-1 guarantees those behaviors will execute.\\u201d\\nOrganizations can use the prompt to encode symbolic slots \\u2014 intents, parameters, and policies \\u2014 as well as tool boundaries and state-dependent rules.\\nA food delivery app, for example, might enforce \\u201cif allergy mentioned, always inform the restaurant,\\u201d while a telecom provider might define \\u201cafter three failed payment attempts, suspend service.\\u201d In both cases, the behavior executes deterministically, not statistically.\\nEight Years in the Making\\nAUI\\u2019s path to Apollo-1 began in 2017, when the team started encoding millions of real task-oriented conversations handled by a 60,000-person human agent workforce.\\nThat work led to a symbolic language capable of separating procedural knowledge \\u2014 steps, constraints, and flows \\u2014 from descriptive knowledge like entities and attributes.\\n\\u201cThe insight was that task-oriented dialogue has universal procedural patterns,\\u201d said Elhelo. \\u201cFood delivery, claims processing, and order management all share similar structures. Once you model that explicitly, you can compute over it deterministically.\\u201d\\nFrom there, the company built the neuro-symbolic reasoner \\u2014 a system that uses the symbolic state to decide what happens next rather than guessing through token prediction.\\nBenchmarks suggest the architecture makes a measurable difference.\\nIn AUI\\u2019s own evaluations, Apollo-1 achieved over 90 percent task completion on the \\u03c4-Bench-Airline benchmark, compared with 60 percent for Claude-4.\\nIt completed 83 percent of live booking chats on Google Flights versus 22 percent for Gemini 2.5-Flash, and 91 percent of retail scenarios on Amazon versus 17 percent for Rufus.\\n\\u201cThese aren\\u2019t incremental improvements,\\u201d said Cohen. \\u201cThey\\u2019re order-of-magnitude reliability differences.\\u201d\\nA Complement, Not a Competitor\\nAUI isn\\u2019t pitching Apollo-1 as a replacement for large language models, but as their necessary counterpart. In Elhelo\\u2019s words: \\u201cTransformers optimize for creative probability. Apollo-1 optimizes for behavioral certainty. Together, they form the complete spectrum of conversational AI.\\u201d\\nThe model is already running in limited pilots with undisclosed Fortune 500 companies across sectors including finance, travel, and retail.\\nAUI has also confirmed a strategic partnership with Google and plans for general availability in November 2025, when it will open APIs, release full documentation, and add voice and image capabilities. Interested potential customers and partners can sign up to receive more information when it becomes available on AUI's website form.\\nUntil then, the company is keeping details under wraps. When asked about what comes next, Elhelo smiled. \\u201cLet\\u2019s just say we\\u2019re preparing an announcement,\\u201d he said. \\u201cSoon.\\u201d\\nToward Conversations That Act\\nFor all its technical sophistication, Apollo-1\\u2019s pitch is simple: make AI that businesses can trust to act \\u2014 not just talk. \\u201cWe\\u2019re on a mission to democratize access to AI that works,\\u201d Cohen said near the end of the interview.\\nWhether Apollo-1 becomes the new standard for task-oriented dialogue remains to be seen. But if AUI\\u2019s architecture performs as promised, the long-standing divide between chatbots that sound human and agents that reliably do human work may finally start to close.\"\n",

Some of these turned out to be deepfakes made with artificial intelligence, forcing police and prosecutors to spend hours checking and debunking them during the investigation. A teenager was eventually charged.\\nIncreasing adoption of AI is transforming Latin America\\u2019s justice system by helping tackle case backlogs and improve access to justice for victims. But it is also exposing deep vulnerabilities through its rampant misuse, bias, and weak oversight as regulators struggle to keep up with the pace of innovation.\\nLaw enforcement doesn\\u2019t yet \\u201chave the capacity to look at these judicial matters beyond just asking whether a piece of evidence is real or not,\\u201d Lucia Camacho, public policy coordinator of Derechos Digitales, a digital rights group, told Rest of World. This may prevent victims from accessing robust legal frameworks and judges with knowledge of the technology, she said.\\nJustice systems across the world are struggling to address harms from deepfakes that are increasingly used for financial scams, in elections, and to spread nonconsensual sexual imagery. There are currently over 1,300 initiatives in 80 countries and international organizations to regulate AI, but not all of these are laws and nor do they all cover deepfakes, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.\\nDeepfake videos surged by 550% between 2019 and 2023 worldwide, according to a report by Security Hero, an independent platform that investigates data protection and digital security. Less than 1% of deepfakes are created in Latin America, compared to more than 70% in Asia, but countries including Mexico, Chile, Brazil, and Colombia have seen some of the highest growth rates, according to a separate study.\\nSome countries have acted. South Korea and Australia criminalize specific deepfake abuses, and the U.S. recently passed the \\u201cTake It Down Act\\u201d that penalizes the creation and distribution of deepfakes without consent. In Latin America, Brazil banned the use of deepfakes in electoral campaigns last year, while Peru and Colombia this year passed AI laws that consider deepfakes an aggravating factor to a crime. Argentina recently proposed a bill criminalizing AI-generated content with up to six-year prison sentences.\\nBut while some countries in Latin America have used the European Union\\u2019s framework as a model, local iterations aren\\u2019t as robust, Franco Giandana, a policy analyst for Latin America and the Caribbean at Access Now, a digital rights group, told Rest of World. Often, \\u201cthe language is too abstract and there\\u2019s still little grasp of the national and regional challenges \\u2014 not just to regulate AI but to build a coherent development strategy suited to our context,\\u201d he said.\\n85% Percentage of judges in Colombia who use free versions of ChatGPT or Microsoft Copilot\\nProsecutors in Chile, Argentina, and Mexico \\u2014 where deepfakes are not yet regulated \\u2014 have struggled to get convictions in recent months on cases involving high school students who created and distributed explicit deepfake images of female classmates without consent.\\nIn December, a judge in Mexico \\u2014 which criminalizes the distribution of sexual content without consent \\u2014 acquitted a 20-year-old man charged with using AI to create sexual images of more than 1,000 women and minors, on a \\u201clack of sufficient evidence to prove his involvement.\\u201d The victims\\u2019 legal team appealed the ruling and the case remains open. The man was separately sentenced to five years by the Mexico City prosecutor\\u2019s office for possessing child sexual abuse material.\\nLast year in Argentina, an 18-year-old man was accused of creating and publishing pornographic deepfake videos of at least 16 of his female classmates on pornography websites, with their real names. Because this is not a crime, Jos\\u00e9 M. D\\u2019Antona, the victims\\u2019 defense attorney, built his case around digital crimes legislation and the psychological harm inflicted upon his clients.\\nWhile the prosecutor\\u2019s office issued orders for the de-indexation of the images from the websites, the victims\\u2019 names can still be found on some pornography sites, D\\u2019Antona told Rest of World. \\u201cThe damage persists,\\u201d he said.\\nThe unregulated use of AI has caused other harms. Across the region, police use AI-based facial recognition systems to track criminals, and have inadvertently harmed innocent citizens.\\nLast year, Jo\\u00e3o Ant\\u00f4nio Trindade Bastos was watching a football game in Aracaju, Brazil, when military police dragged him from the stadium in front of 10,000 fans. A surveillance camera had misidentified him as a wanted fugitive. Weeks earlier, a woman was arrested during carnival celebrations for someone else\\u2019s crime. Both of them were released once it was determined they were not the individuals in question.\\nSuch cases are inevitable. Most AI systems are trained primarily on data from white populations, generating \\u201cfalse positives\\u201d when scanning Indigenous, Afro-descendant, and female faces, Dilmar Villena, executive director of Hiperderecho, a Peruvian digital rights organization, told Rest of World. Similarly, Chile\\u2019s Urban Criminal Prediction System has been criticized for relying on what experts call \\u201cdirty data\\u201d \\u2014 police records riddled with racial profiling and selective enforcement.\\nChile\\u2019s National Police and the Deputy Ministry of Public Security did not respond to a request for comment from Rest of World.\\nSuch use of facial recognition and other AI tools \\u201cshould be heavily regulated because we\\u2019re talking about the state using weapons against its own citizens,\\u201d Felipe Rocha, digital coordinator at Lapin, a Brazilian justice-tech research organization, told Rest of World. In June, Brazil\\u2019s Ministry of Justice and Public Security issued a ruling that allows public security agencies to use AI in criminal investigations, and bans the use of remote biometric identification in public spaces except when searching for missing persons or when there is imminent threat to life.\\nEven as regulators struggle to keep up, courts across Latin America are increasingly turning to AI to classify cases and automate repetitive tasks.\\nIn 2023, Colombian judge Juan Manuel Padilla chose a simple case on his docket to test the application of AI: He drafted a ruling on an autistic child who needed state-funded medical treatment with the help of ChatGPT.\\nThe case set a precedent in the use of AI in judicial decisions in the country. Not long after, Colombia established AI courtroom guidelines, allowing AI for routine tasks while mandating human oversight. About 85% of judges in the country now use free versions of ChatGPT or Microsoft Copilot, according to a 2025 study by the Universidad de los Andes. But most judges receive minimal AI training, leaving them to independently navigate integrating algorithms into legal traditions.\\nElsewhere in the region, Brazil uses SAJ Digital, an AI tool, to help speed up cases and streamline magistrates\\u2019 workload. In Argentina, Prometea has cut legal opinion processing from 190 days to one hour. Colombia\\u2019s Constitutional Court has deployed PretorIA, an AI tool based on Argentina\\u2019s technology. It sorts through more than 2,700 acciones de tutela \\u2014 legal requests by Colombian citizens for the protection of their fundamental rights \\u2014 daily.\\nPadilla, the Colombian judge, relies on AI tools to streamline case documentation, but strict regulation alone will not be enough to confront the issue of deepfakes within the justice system, he told Rest of World.\\n\\u201cSelf-regulation is the only efficient path,\\u201d he said. \\u201cNo legal framework will ever keep pace with the speed of AI.\\u201d\"\n",

Today, we are releasing the Gemini 2.5 Computer Use model, our new specialized model built on Gemini 2.5 Pro\\u2019s visual understanding and reasoning capabilities that powers agents capable of interacting with user interfaces (UIs). It outperforms leading alternatives on multiple web and mobile control benchmarks, all with lower latency. Developers can access these capabilities via the Gemini API in Google AI Studio and Vertex AI.\\nWhile AI models can interface with software through structured APIs, many digital tasks still require direct interaction with graphical user interfaces, for example, filling and submitting forms. To complete these tasks, agents must navigate web pages and applications just as humans do: by clicking, typing and scrolling. The ability to natively fill out forms, manipulate interactive elements like dropdowns and filters, and operate behind logins is a crucial next step in building powerful, general-purpose agents.\\nHow it works\\nThe model\\u2019s core capabilities are exposed through the new `computer_use` tool in the Gemini API and should be operated within a loop. Inputs to the tool are the user request, screenshot of the environment, and a history of recent actions. The input can also specify whether to exclude functions from the full list of supported UI actions or specify additional custom functions to include.\\nGemini 2.5 Computer Use Model flow\\nThe model then analyzes these inputs and generates a response, typically a function call representing one of the UI actions such as clicking or typing. This response may also contain a request for an end user confirmation, which is required for certain actions such as making a purchase. The client-side code then executes the received action.\\nAfter the action is executed, a new screenshot of the GUI and the current URL are sent back to the Computer Use model as a function response restarting the loop. This iterative process continues until the task is complete, an error occurs or the interaction is terminated by a safety response or user decision.\\nThe Gemini 2.5 Computer Use model is primarily optimized for web browsers, but also demonstrates strong promise for mobile UI control tasks. It is not yet optimized for desktop OS-level control.\\nCheck out a few demos below to see the model in action (shown here at 3X speed).\\nPrompt: \\u201cFrom https:\\/\\/tinyurl.com\\/pet-care-signup, get all details for any pet with a California residency and add them as a guest in my spa CRM at https:\\/\\/pet-luxe-spa.web.app\\/. Then, set up a follow up visit appointment with the specialist Anima Lavar for October 10th anytime after 8am. The reason for the visit is the same as their requested treatment.\\u201d\\nPrompt: \\u201cMy art club brainstormed tasks ahead of our fair. The board is chaotic and I need your help organizing the tasks into some categories I created. Go to sticky-note-jam.web.app and ensure notes are clearly in the right sections. Drag them there if not.\\u201d\\nHow it performs\\nThe Gemini 2.5 Computer Use model demonstrates strong performance on multiple web and mobile control benchmarks. The table below includes results from self-reported numbers, evaluations run by Browserbase and evaluations we ran ourselves. Evaluation details are available in the Gemini 2.5 Computer Use evaluation info and in Browserbase\\u2019s blog post. Unless otherwise indicated, scores shown are for computer use tools exposed via API.\\nGemini 2.5 Computer Use outperforms leading alternatives on multiple benchmarks\\nThe model offers leading quality for browser control at the lowest latency, as measured by performance on the Browserbase harness for Online-Mind2Web.\\nGemini 2.5 Computer Use delivers high accuracy while maintaining low latency\\nHow we approached safety\\nWe believe that the only way to build agents that will benefit everyone is to be responsible from the start. AI agents that control computers introduce unique risks, including intentional misuse by users, unexpected model behavior, and prompt injections and scams in the web environment. Thus, it is critical to implement safety guardrails with care.\\nWe have trained safety features directly into the model to address these three key risks (described in the Gemini 2.5 Computer Use System Card).\\nFurther, we also provide developers with safety controls, which empower developers to prevent the model from auto-completing potentially high-risk or harmful actions. Examples of these actions include harming a system's integrity, compromising security, bypassing CAPTCHAs, or controlling medical devices. The controls:\\n- Per-step safety service: An out-of-model, inference-time safety service that assesses each action the model proposes before it\\u2019s executed.\\n- System instructions: Developers can further specify that the agent either refuses or asks for user confirmation before it takes specific kinds of high-stakes actions. (Example in documentation).\\nAdditional recommendations for developers on safety measures and best practices can be found in our documentation. While these safeguards are designed to reduce risk, we urge all developers to thoroughly test their systems before launch.\\nHow early testers have used it\\nGoogle teams have already deployed the model to production for use cases including UI testing, which can make software development signficantly faster. Versions of this model have also been powering Project Mariner, the Firebase Testing Agent, and some agentic capabilities in AI Mode in Search.\\nUsers from our early access program have also been testing the model to power personal assistants, workflow automation, and UI testing, and have seen strong results. In their own words:\\n\\u201cA lot of our workflows require interacting with interfaces meant for humans where speed is especially important. Gemini 2.5 Computer Use is far ahead of the competition, often being 50% faster and better than the next best solutions we\\u2019ve considered.\\u201d - Poke.com, a proactive AI assistant in iMessage, WhatsApp and SMS with multiple third-party and agentic workflows.\\n\\u201cOur agents run fully autonomously, performing work where small mistakes in collecting and parsing data are unacceptable. Gemini 2.5 Computer Use outperformed other models at reliably parsing context in complex cases, increasing performance by up to 18% on our hardest evals.\\u201d \\u2014 Autotab, a drop-in AI agent.\\n\\u201cWhen conventional scripts encounter failures, the model assesses the current screen state and autonomously ascertains the required actions to complete the workflow. This implementation now successfully rehabilitates over 60% of executions (which used to take multiple days to fix).\\u201d \\u2014 Google\\u2019s payments platform team, which implemented the Computer Use model as a contingency mechanism to address fragile end-to-end UI tests that contributed to 25% of all test failures.\\nHow to get started\\nStarting today, the model is available in public preview, accessible via the Gemini API on Google AI Studio and Vertex AI.\\n- Try it now: In a demo environment hosted by Browserbase.\\n- Start building: Dive into our reference and documentation (see Vertex AI docs for enterprise use) to learn how to build your own agent loop locally with Playwright or in a cloud VM with Browserbase.\\n- Join the community: We\\u2019re excited to see what you build.

MCPs aim to bring clarity, control, and confidence to the often-chaotic world of AI model development.\\nWhat is MCP and why does it matter?\\nAI models do not operate in isolation, they are the product of complex pipelines involving data, code, dependencies, and human decision-making.\\nToday, however, most organizations treat the final model as a black box, with little visibility into how it was built or whether it can be trusted.\\nSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!\\nThat\\u2019s where MCP comes in. It\\u2019s an open, vendor-neutral standard designed to capture the full picture behind an AI model, not just the model itself.\\nFrom the data and code that shape it to the environment it runs in, MCP packages everything into a signed, digital file that computers can easily digest, ensuring traceability, integrity, and reproducibility across the model\\u2019s lifecycle.\\nIn other words, MCP brings the same rigor and transparency we expect from modern software supply chains into the world of AI. As pressure mounts around responsible AI, from regulators, customers, and the public, that shift isn\\u2019t just helpful, it\\u2019s essential.\\nWhy does MCP matter right now?\\nThe adoption of AI in production environments is exploding, and existing tooling has failed to keep up with the specific needs of machine learning (ML) and large language model (LLM) workflows.\\nTraditional DevOps pipelines weren\\u2019t built to track ephemeral experiments, scattered datasets, or the dozens of packages and GPU drivers that ML workloads depend on. This creates significant blind spots.\\nIn fact, according to our report, 94% of organizations use open-source software in their production environments, including in AI workloads, but nearly 60% admit they lack confidence in their ability to track the origin and security of AI-related packages and models.\\nThat\\u2019s where MCP steps in. By offering a consistent, secure, and automation-ready protocol for model management, MCP makes it possible to reproduce results by capturing the full runtime context, scale deployments across cloud, on-prem, or edge environments, and enforce compliance through integrated license checks and vulnerability scanning.\\nIt also streamlines collaboration across teams by serving as a single source of trust for all model-related assets.\\nBy embedding AI workflows into existing software supply chain practices, MCP enables teams to reduce risk, accelerate delivery, and build AI applications that are as trustworthy as they are powerful.\\nIn short, it's a foundational step toward making AI models first-class citizens in enterprise software development.\\nWhat is the role of MCP in the software supply chain?\\nThere is a growing realization that models are more than just code, they're the new binaries.\\nLike software packages, models are compiled outputs from upstream work: datasets, configurations, dependencies, and training logic. Yet in many organizations, they remain loosely managed and disconnected from standard DevOps and MLOps pipelines.\\nTo change that, forward-thinking teams are starting to treat AI models with the same discipline as any other software artifact.\\nThis means capturing the full context of the model lifecycle; where it came from, how it was built, what it depends on, and how it should be deployed or governed.\\nThat\\u2019s the aim of MCP. By defining a consistent structure for tracking and sharing model components, MCP helps close the gap between experimental AI work and scalable, secure deployment.\\nIt supports integrations with popular open-source frameworks like MLflow, Hugging Face, and LangChain, allowing developers to work in familiar environments while layering in the governance needed for production use.\\nOrganizations adopting MCP are now able to:\\n- Ingest and manage models from diverse tools and training platforms\\n- Apply policy-based governance, including license compliance and vulnerability scanning\\n- Track provenance, version history, and dependencies with confidence\\n- Distribute models securely across cloud, on-prem, or edge environments through unified pipelines\\nHow does MCP help move AI from experimentation to enterprise?\\nMost AI projects today lack the basic hygiene that software teams take for granted: clear provenance, dependency tracking, version control, and security checks. This gap makes it nearly impossible to reproduce results, manage risk, or respond to regulatory pressure.\\nMCP offers a way forward by bringing structured, automated traceability to AI models, from the base model and training data to the runtime environment and security status, borrowing from decades of best practice in the software supply chain.\\nThat means fewer unknowns when models are reused, updated, or audited, and more confidence when deploying AI into customer-facing or regulated environments.\\nBy integrating seamlessly with existing CI\\/CD and development workflows, MCP does not just promise responsible AI, it makes it practical.\\nWhat\\u2019s next for MCP?\\nMCP is still under active development, with ongoing improvements to its specification and tooling. The protocol is supported by multiple open-source AI communities and is increasingly seen as the foundation for secure, reproducible, and enterprise-ready AI.\\nAs organizations work to deploy AI systems responsibly, MCP provides a structured way to track and manage models, drawing on established best practices from the software supply chain, like version control, provenance tracking, and security checks.\\nBecause just like with traditional software, AI models without context are a liability. With MCP, they can become secure, manageable assets, ready for production.\\nWe've featured the best mobile app development software.\\nThis article was produced as part of TechRadarPro's Expert Insights channel where we feature the best and brightest minds in the technology industry today.

Data centers house the computer systems that enable internet\\nThis series explores the impacts of data centers on water supply, energy use and air quality in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. Data centers house the computer systems that enable internet activity and, increasingly, artificial intelligence. Northern Virginia, in the middle of the Bay watershed, is the global epicenter of these warehouse-like facilities. Their footprint is now spreading into Maryland and Pennsylvania too.\\nThe data centers that increasingly fuel our AI-enabled interactions need to run 24 hours a day to keep the internet going. So, like grocery stores or hospitals, these facilities include backup power generators, often fueled by diesel or natural gas, and intended to run only during emergencies.\\nBut in the Chesapeake Bay region, where exponential data center growth has put unprecedented strain on the power grid, such emergencies are no longer unthinkable.\\nThis past summer, a fire knocked out an electrical substation in the midst of Data Center Alley in Loudoun County, VA. The outage caused data centers served by that station to use backup power for \\u201cseveral days\\u201d in late June and early July, according to the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality.\\nEach data center is equipped with sometimes dozens, sometimes hundreds of tractor trailer-sized generators largely running on diesel or natural gas. Burning these fossil fuels for power emits pollutants such as particulate matter, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxides and carbon dioxide. Some of these pose risks to human health while others degrade air quality in general, affecting the environment and the water where pollutants eventually flow.\\nThe global race to build the infrastructure enabling AI is fueling a rash of new data centers that use exponentially more power than their predecessors. And, the more power they use, the more backup power they need.\\nVirginia\\u2019s DEQ requires air permits for each of these generators. These allow them to kick on periodically for 15- or 30-minute increments to ensure they will work in an emergency. The permits restrict when those tests can occur, avoiding hours when heavy commuter traffic is also contributing to air pollution, for example.\\nDEQ officials wrote in an email to the Chesapeake Bay Journal in September that it has issued permits for 5,447 data center generators in Loudoun County alone. Together, they have the capacity to provide more than 13.6 gigawatts of power. (For comparison, the North Anna Nuclear Generating Station in Louisa County, VA, has the capacity to produce 1.8 gigawatts of power.)\\nDEQ officials said their database does not break down the generators by the types of fuel they use or by the amount of pollutants each emits. There is some variation among units.\\nA DEQ guidance document states that \\u201cwhile the vast majority of the existing Virginia gen-set fleet is currently diesel-fired, there are cleaner and more efficient technologies available.\\u201d\\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency uses a tiered system for regulating non-road diesel engines that rates the machines for compliance. Tier I means the machine has the least permissible pollution reductions, and Tier IV means it meets the highest pollution reduction standards.\\nState or local governments can choose to require higher tiers of pollution removal from a project or industry, especially when the technology has been proven available. But such requirements can be costly to an industry that still has a choice when it comes to locations for new projects.\\nChristie Sayes, a professor of environmental science at Baylor University, said the resistance to costlier, cleaner technologies is not limited to data centers.\\n\\u201cIn airplanes and cars, catalytic converters exist that are really efficient,\\u201d Sayes said. \\u201cBut in a race to the bottom to make the most inexpensive vehicle, we don\\u2019t use that technology to limit pollution.\\u201d\\nEven so, Loudoun County Supervisor Michael Turner says he\\u2019s ready to require more of data centers wanting to locate in Loudoun, which is already home to the highest concentration of them in the world. The county\\u2019s board earlier this year ended by-right development of land for data centers so that every data center project must be approved by its members. And Turner would like to see more requirements made of the generators that accompany each project.\\n\\u201cWithin the data industry, I\\u2019m sure I\\u2019m known as the Tier IV-generator guy,\\u201d Turner said of his desire for data center generators to use the best pollution reduction measures available.\\nDoing so could have other advantages in an uncertain energy future where onsite power generation could be the next frontier.\\nOne data center company is now using Tier IV natural gas-fired combustion turbines as a main power source, in addition to diesel backup generators. Vantage began building the onsite power generation after being told by Dominion Energy in 2022 that its $1 billion project would not be able to get power from the constrained grid for up to three years.\\nThe summer of 2022 was a tipping point for the data center power crunch in Virginia. State regulators proposed allowing Northern Virginia data centers to use backup generators in a more continuous manner for a five-month period during which energy \\u201ctransmission problems\\u201d were anticipated. Homeowners\\u2019 associations that were already opposing data center projects in their backyards quickly coalesced to contest the proposal. The data center industry ended up asking regulators to rescind it.\\nBut the outsized power demands have only grown since then, especially as more hyperscale data centers enabling AI come online. This past summer, the region faced another test of its grid when power demand for cooling reached record highs during heat waves in June and July.\\nPJM Interconnection, which manages the grid for the northeastern U.S., issued permission in late June for places with high power consumption to use backup systems instead of the grid to prevent blackouts.\\nA report commissioned by Virginia\\u2019s General Assembly late last year found that backup generators do emit harmful pollutants but that \\u201cexisting regulations largely curb adverse impacts.\\u201d It acknowledges, though, that a \\u201cworst-case\\u201d scenario involving a widespread power outage could cause hundreds of backup generators to start up in a concentrated area, fouling regional air quality.\\n\\u201cI think the thing that will get everybody\\u2019s attention is when Northern Virginia blacks out or the grid fails,\\u201d Turner said. \\u201cI think we\\u2019ve come closer to that this summer than we have before.\\u201d\\n(0) comments\\nWelcome to the discussion.\\nLog In\\nWe aim to provide a forum for fair and open dialogue.\\nPlease use language that is accurate and respectful.\\nComments may not include:\\n* Insults, verbal attacks or degrading statements\\n* Explicit or vulgar language\\n* Information that violates a person's right to privacy\\n* Advertising or solicitations\\n* Misrepresentation of your identity or affiliation\\n* Incorrect, fraudulent or misleading content\\n* Spam or comments that do not pertain to the posted article\\nWe reserve the right to edit or decline comments that do follow these guidelines.\"\n",

One of the biggest criticisms is the rush to push AI everywhere in a bid to outpace Chinese rivals. Some AI startups are adopting China\\u2019s grueling \\u20189-9-6 work schedule,\\\" harming instead of helping productivity. Critics argue that the fast pace is overwhelming teams, killing creativity and wasting money. To mitigate this problem, the 30\\/60\\/90 AI plan is a simple way to roll out AI at work without burning people out or eroding trust.\\nWhat Is The 30\\/60\\/90 AI Plan?\\nThere\\u2019s no question that AI is here to stay, and it\\u2019s important to develop a reasonable comfort level around its use. But recent reports claim that \\u201cAI work slop\\u201d is interfering with productivity, wasting time and costing businesses millions of dollars. Other critics are complaining that AI is creating \\u201cdigital tool fatigue\\\" due to so many distractions and that organizations are not offering adequate support and training.\\nWorkers are overwhelmed by too many tools and executives pushing \\u201cAI everywhere\\u201d strategies. This often leads to burnout, quality drops and wasted budgets. Artificial intelligence promised to transform work, but a new analysis from Sociallyin reveals that AI use in video marketing dropped sharply in 2025, from 75% of marketers in 2024 to just 51% this year. The pullback highlights a growing reality that teams are no longer impressed by novelty because they need results.\\nSociallyin argues the smarter approach is phased adoption, with clarity on where AI genuinely adds value. \\\"The re-calibration of AI use signals a new maturity in the workplace. Marketers have realized that while AI speeds up certain tasks like captioning and idea generation, it struggles to replace human creativity in areas that require nuance, originality and trust. With video marketing now a $200B+ global industry, Sociallyin\\u2019s findings reflect a broader truth: the future of AI at work isn\\u2019t \\u2018more,\\u2019 it\\u2019s \\u2018smarter.\\u2019\\u201d\\nExperts argue that organizations can adopt a strategy to make AI work without creating employee burnout and mistrust. Keith Kakadia, social media expert and founder of Sociallyin, developed a 30-60-90 AI plan to help organizations \\u201cright-size\\u201d their AI strategy so workers use tools where they help most, without sacrificing creativity or trust.\\n1. 30 Days: Audit and Pilot\\nIn the first thirty days, you identify repetitive, low-risk tasks like captioning, transcripts idea outlines. Then test one or two AI tools and document time saved and Keep humans as final reviewers.\\n2. 60 Days: Integrate and Optimize\\nIn 60 days you apply AI for platform-specific cut downs (TikTok vs LinkedIn). Then, you build approval workflows for AI-assisted content and tart measuring impact beyond \\u201cengagement,\\u201d such as retention and conversions.\\n3. 90 Days: Scale and Govern\\nIn 90 days, Kakadia says you train staff on best practices and risks, establish guardrails for ethics, accessibility and bias. And track AI\\u2019s bottom-line impact, not just output volume.\\nHe warns that treating AI as a cure-all risks eroding brand trust and employee morale.The 30-60-90 AI plan is a gradual strategy to introducing AI in the workplace. It involves three steps: audit and pilot, integrate and optimize and scale and govern.\\n\\u201cWhat executives need to understand is that AI at work isn\\u2019t about volume, it\\u2019s about velocity and precision,\\\" Kakadia explains. \\u201cWhen you combine AI with human oversight, you reduce burnout while keeping quality high. But when you over-automate, you erode brand trust and trust takes years to rebuild.\\u201d\\nThe Main Advantages Of The 30\\/60\\/90 AI Plan\\nI spoke with Kakadia, who says that when he talks to executives about AI, the biggest mistake he sees is that some rush to push what he calls \\u201cAI everywhere.\\u201d But \\u201cThe win isn\\u2019t AI everywhere,\\u201d he told me. \\u201cIt\\u2019s AI where it buys back time so humans can spend it on taste, storytelling and strategy.\\u201d He warns that \\u201cAI everywhere\\u201d actually overwhelms teams, kills creativity and wastes money.\\nThat\\u2019s why he believes in the 30-60-90 plan. He points out that it\\u2019s a very simple way to roll out AI at work without burning people out or eroding trust. And Kakadia believes the model works because it makes AI adoption intentional instead of reactive. He cites five main advantages of the 30\\/60\\/90 AI plan:\\n1. Reduces Burnout\\nKakadia asserts that AI can help with repetitive tasks like captions, transcripts or idea outlines. \\u201cThese take time but don\\u2019t require much creativity,\\u201d he adds. \\u201cIn our analysis of video marketing trends, we saw AI adoption drop from 75% in 2024 to just 51% this year. That signals fatigue. A phased plan keeps workers from feeling overwhelmed by too many tools at once.\\u201d\\n2. Protects Brand Trust\\nHe cites statistics that video quality directly impacts brand trust, and 91% of consumers say so, adding that AI can speed up production, but without human review, mistakes slip through and damage credibility. He stresses that the plan builds in checkpoints so AI supports, but doesn\\u2019t replace, human oversight.\\n3. Aligns AI With Business Outcomes\\nKakadia charges that it\\u2019s not enough to say \\u201cAI saves time.\\u201d He argues that you need to tie it to real business metrics: retention, conversions and engagement. \\u201cFor example, websites with video convert 65% higher than those without (WebFX),\\u201d he points out. \\u201cThe plan ensures AI contributes to those outcomes instead of just adding more output.\\u201d\\n4. Balances Speed With Creativity\\nHe cites statistics that people watch 17 hours of video per week on average, and 78% prefer short-form for learning about products. \\u201cAI can quickly repurpose content into these formats, but the creative angles such as storytelling and cultural nuance still come from humans. And that model protects that balance.\\u201d\\n5. Provides Guardrails for Long-Term Use\\nKakadia emphasizes that accessibility in video has surged 572% since 2021, with captions now seen as a trust signal. \\u201cAI can help scale accessibility, but the 90-day stage introduces governance (standards for ethics, accessibility and bias), so adoption doesn\\u2019t outpace responsibility,\\u201d he contends.\\nA Final Takeaway On The 30\\/60\\/90 AI Plan\\nModern technology seems to overlook or ignore platitudes that rose from past experience. Cliches like \\u201cHaste makes waste\\\" or \\u201cBetter safe than sorry\\u201d or \\u201cLook before you leap,\\u201d carry historical wisdom, reminding us that doing things too fast yields poor results.\\nI always believed Aesop was right: the tortoise gets to the finish line first, no matter how hard and fast the hare races to complete a project or meet a deadline. And research is on my side. Plodding\\u2014not frantic rushing\\u2014gets you to the finish line quicker and the quality of the output is far more superior. Slowing down the pace of phasing AI into employee hands with the 30\\/60\\/90 AI plan has the potential to mitigate much of the chaos, confusion and stress currently plaguing the American workforce.\"\n",

With a staggering $455 billion in contracted backlog as of the end of its fiscal 2026 first quarter (which ended Aug. 31), the tech company is likely to see significant revenue expansion for several years into the future. Its shares have already risen by more than 71% so far in 2025, and its market cap now exceeds $801 billion.\\nHowever, it may not grow as quickly as some smaller, more flexible companies that are built entirely around data, AI models, and automation.\\nOracle could still stumble\\nOracle has become a force to reckon with in the AI infrastructure space, driven by its multiyear deals with AI leaders such as OpenAI, xAI, Meta Platforms, Advanced Micro Devices, and Nvidia.\\nIn its fiscal first quarter, Oracle's cloud infrastructure revenue spiked 54% year over year to $3.3 billion. Oracle's AI database (which vectorizes data to make it understandable for large language models) and multicloud strategy (embedding its database regions across hyperscalers such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Alphabet's Google Cloud) are proving to be key competitive advantages. These strategies should result in higher revenue and customer stickiness.\\nNYSE: ORCL\\nKey Data Points\\nStill, despite its exceptional operational performance, the company missed analysts' consensus estimates for revenue and earnings in fiscal Q1. It also reported negative free cash flow. Oracle says it expects to lay out $35 billion in capital expenditures in fiscal 2026. All this suggests that management is sacrificing near-term profits for potential long-term gains.\\nOracle's excessive dependence on a few massive contracts, such as its $300 billion deal with OpenAI, also exposes it to a high degree of counterparty risk. If OpenAI changes architectures or pivots away from Oracle Cloud, it could dramatically affect Oracle's performance.\\nThis is why investors looking at Oracle might want to consider a couple of alternatives instead. There are two companies, in particular, that have performance potential that could help them grow faster than Oracle and even surpass Oracle's $801 billion market capitalization by 2030.\\nPalantir: $436 billion market cap\\nWhile Oracle is one of the dominant players in global AI infrastructure buildout, Palantir Technologies (PLTR 1.44%) has become a prominent enterprise AI player by helping governments and commercial organizations make data-driven decisions.\\nNASDAQ: PLTR\\nKey Data Points\\nPalantir's performance is its key to surpassing Oracle's market cap by 2030. In the second quarter, the company's revenue jumped 48% year over year to surpass $1 billion. Its operating margin improved by 9 percentage points to 46% while adjusted free cash flow reached $569 million. Palantir is proving it can capture and monetize demand for AI-powered software solutions.\\nPalantir's Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) has become its main growth engine. AIP integrates large language models with its proprietary, ontology-based architecture -- a framework that associates physical assets with their digital representations. This enables it to address complex, real-world enterprise challenges accurately, reliably, and cost-effectively. Additionally, the company's go-to-market strategy, which involves running boot camps to enable potential clients to test how AIP would work in their live workflows, has dramatically accelerated its sales cycle. AIP's real-world impacts are already visible. Clients are seeing significant gains in speed, accuracy, and operational efficiency across critical workflows.\\nPalantir's government business has a sticky customer base. Since various government agencies and departments use its software in mission-critical operations, it's complex to switch to a competing provider. Meanwhile, the U.S. Army's $10 billion, 10-year enterprise contract with Palantir provides a steady, long-term revenue base.\\nEven better, Palantir can scale up its software offerings, such as Foundry, Gotham, and AIP, using far fewer resources, relatively speaking, than a hardware-based business like Oracle.\\nPalantir stock is admittedly extremely expensive, trading at 204.8 times its expected forward earnings. While the risk of valuation compression remains, history shows that growth companies that are dominant in their industries can keep trading at high premiums for long periods of time. If Palantir maintains a long-term revenue growth rate of over 30% and an operating margin of over 40%, its market cap could exceed Oracle's by 2030.\\nEli Lilly: $800 billion market cap\\nEli Lilly's (LLY -0.09%) market capitalization could surpass Oracle's well before 2030, considering the company is already nearly equal to it. In the second quarter, its revenue rose 38% year over year to $15.6 billion, while non-GAAP earnings per share surged 61% to $6.31. Management has also significantly increased its revenue and earnings guidance for 2025.\\nNYSE: LLY\\nKey Data Points\\nThe biggest growth driver for the business is tirzepatide, which Lilly markets as Mounjaro for type 2 diabetes and Zepbound for weight management. Mounjaro and Zepbound reported revenues of $5.2 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively, in the second quarter. In the first half of 2025, Eli Lilly produced 1.6 times as many salable tirzepatide doses as it did in the prior-year period. While Eli Lilly accounted for a 57% share of U.S. prescriptions for incretin analogues (drugs that mimic gut hormones), the rapid ramp-up in manufacturing capacity of tirzepatide could help the company capture an even bigger share in the coming months.\\nTirzepatide also demonstrated cardiovascular benefits in a large, phase 3 clinical study. This may help the drug secure expanded insurance coverage and further penetration in the diabetes and weight loss markets.\\nEli Lilly expects that orforglipron, its candidate for a once-daily oral GLP-1 agonist, will be its next big catalyst. Because orforglipron removes the need for injections from the equation, and also has a lower manufacturing cost, this oral weight loss and diabetes drug could see rapid adoption once it earns regulatory approval.\\nBeyond incretin analogues, Lilly's drug pipeline also features late-stage assets such as donanemab for Alzheimer's disease and retatrutide for metabolic disorders. Approvals of these drugs would help further diversify the company's portfolio. Market research company Evaluate forecasts that tirzepatide will generate nearly $62 billion in annual revenue by 2030. Hence, it seems quite possible for Eli Lilly to increase its revenue at an annualized rate of over 20% and maintain operating margins over 40% through the next five years. That momentum could easily push its market capitalization past that of Oracle.\"\n",

      "    \"text_content\":\"Page title: Rethinking AI security architectures beyond Earth - Help Net Security\\nSocial card title: Rethinking AI security architectures beyond Earth - Help Net Security\\nSocial card description: AI-driven space systems highlight the trade-offs in centralized vs decentralized security, shaping how networks detect and respond to threats.\\nRethinking AI security architectures beyond Earth\\nIf you think managing cloud security is complex, try doing it across hundreds of satellites orbiting the planet. Each one is a moving endpoint that must stay secure while communicating through long, delay-prone links. A new study explores how AI could automate security for space systems and whether the best approach is to centralize control or spread it out.\\nSpace security enters a new era\\nCommercial satellite constellations are changing how the space industry works. Dozens of companies now run networks for broadband, imaging, and navigation. As these systems grow, keeping them secure becomes a technical and operational challenge. Each satellite depends on constant communication with the ground, and every one of those links adds another potential risk.\\nAI is emerging as a way to manage those risks automatically. It can detect anomalies, spot malicious activity, and recommend countermeasures based on telemetry data. The question is where that intelligence should live. Should AI be trained and run on the ground, or should satellites handle some of the work themselves?\\nThe architecture question: where should AI live?\\nThe researchers outline three architectures: centralized, distributed, and federated. In a centralized model, the heavy lifting happens on Earth. Satellites send telemetry data to a large AI system, which analyzes it and sends back security updates. Training is fast because powerful ground-based resources are available, but the response to threats is slower due to long transmission times.\\nIn a distributed model, satellites still rely on the ground for training but perform inference locally. This setup reduces delay when responding to a threat, though smaller onboard systems can limit model accuracy.\\nFederated learning goes a step further. Satellites train and infer on their own data without sending it to Earth. They share only model updates with other satellites and ground stations. This keeps latency low and improves privacy, but synchronizing models across a large constellation can be difficult.\\nSpace AI architectures: (a) centralized, (b) distributed, (c) federated\\nCentralization makes a comeback\\nAccording to co-author Noam Schmitt, there is a visible shift back toward centralization in commercial satellite operations. \\u201cThe trend towards centralized architectures, where operations are ground-based, is noticeable in various areas,\\u201d he explained. \\u201cFrom a commercial perspective, AWS has launched AWS Ground Station, which centralizes data and management of satellites on their data centers. This includes direct integration with their AI platform Amazon SageMaker and their Digital Twin functionality. This strategy also seems to be replicated with their Kuiper constellation.\\u201d\\nSchmitt added that other providers are following a similar path. \\u201cMicrosoft\\u2019s Azure Orbital, now part of SLI, and Google Cloud\\u2019s partnership with SpaceX show that major players are aligning around central control. From a hardware perspective, there is currently no major player using onboard AI in satellites. NASA is testing onboard AI for observation satellites, but large-scale deployment remains far away.\\u201d\\nHe noted that better bandwidth between satellites and the ground, along with fewer hardware limitations on Earth, are key factors driving this shift.\\nPerformance trade-offs every CISO will recognize\\nThe team tested centralized and federated setups using simulations that measured accuracy and latency. Centralized learning reached target accuracy about thirteen times faster than the largest federated configuration. Yet the centralized model had higher inference latency, which grew as more satellites were added. Federated setups kept latency stable even as the network expanded.\\nIn other words, centralized systems are faster to train but slower to react. Federated designs take longer to train but handle live detection more quickly.\\nThe reality of security incidents\\nRobert Byrne, Field Strategist at One Identity, told Help Net Security that architecture choices must also be viewed through the lens of recovery and resilience. \\u201cIn the event of a major cybersecurity incident, it must be assumed that all components of the satellite infrastructure have been compromised. This includes the Ground, Space, and User segments, each of which will require recovery procedures,\\u201d he said.\\nByrne pointed out that while space-based architectures vary in resilience, recovery often depends on shared fundamentals. \\u201cMost systems across all segments will need to be restored from secure backups,\\u201d he said. \\u201cOne architectural enhancement to help reduce recovery time is the implementation of distributed Inter-Satellite Links. These links enable faster propagation of recovery updates between satellites, minimizing latency and accelerating system-wide restoration.\\u201d\\nHe added that threats such as DDoS attacks, signal jamming, and eavesdropping continue to grow, often influenced by geopolitical tensions. But in his view, the most vulnerable component remains people. \\u201cSocial engineering and phishing attacks continue to be the most cost-effective and successful methods for compromising control systems, particularly within Satellite Control Centers,\\u201d Byrne said. He suggested that applying zero trust identity frameworks and emerging decentralized identity solutions could reduce the risk of human-driven compromise.\\nWhat could come next in AI-driven defense\\nThe authors plan to expand their work beyond performance testing. They want to explore how different architectures handle threats such as tenant isolation and data confidentiality. They also mention digital twins and split learning as promising additions. Digital twins could simulate the constellation and test countermeasures before deployment, while split learning could reduce data transfer by splitting inference between satellites and ground stations.\\nHybrid approaches may also emerge. In those systems, satellites could handle immediate detection, and the ground could manage training and long-term analysis. That mix could offer better scalability and faster incident response without overloading the satellites\\u2019 computing resources.\\nLessons that reach far beyond space\\nAlthough the research centers on space, the same design questions apply to many other areas. Distributed manufacturing systems, connected cars, and energy grids all depend on reliable communication and fast detection. The way these satellite networks handle data and security could influence how AI-driven defense evolves across industries.\\nCentralized control simplifies oversight but can slow down reaction time. Decentralized systems demand more coordination but offer faster responses and better resilience. The best solution depends on context.\"\n",

AI is the new edge. Master it, or watch your competitors dominate while you're left behind.\\nThe Age of Manipulation Has Arrived\\nFor centuries, marketing has been about one thing: controlling attention. The printing press allowed merchants to control through posters. Radio and television hijacked it through sound and spectacle. The internet turned attention into a tradable commodity. But now, AI has changed the battlefield.\\nWe\\u2019re no longer in the era of persuasion through brute force repetition. We\\u2019re in the era of precision manipulation, where algorithms dissect human psychology at scale. What marketers once guessed, AI now knows. What they once fumbled toward, AI executes flawlessly in milliseconds.\\nThis isn\\u2019t about clever slogans anymore. It\\u2019s about behavioral control. And only those willing to embrace this darker reality will survive.\\nAI Is the Perfect Machiavellian Tool\\nNiccolo Machiavelli wrote that it is better for a ruler to be feared than loved, if he cannot be both. Marketing in the age of AI is no different. Algorithms do not \\u201ccare\\u201d about your brand. They don\\u2019t seek loyalty or goodwill. They seek results.\\nAI analyzes micro-behaviors invisible to the human eye:\\n- How long your cursor hovers over a word.\\n- The milliseconds you pause on a headline before scrolling.\\n- The patterns of your late-night browsing that reveal vulnerabilities you didn\\u2019t know you had.\\nThis is raw, unfiltered power. Machiavelli would have admired it. Because AI doesn\\u2019t ask permission. It doesn\\u2019t moralize it. It simply exploits.\\nThe Tyranny of Personalization\\nPersonalization is the benevolent mask of AI. Marketers love to frame it as \\u201ccreating better experiences\\u201d for the customer. But strip away the polish, and personalization is a form of tyranny.\\nWhen an AI system learns exactly what you want before you even want it, it bypasses conscious choice. You\\u2019re no longer shopping. You\\u2019re being shepherded. Each ad, each offer, each suggestion is an invisible push toward a predetermined outcome.\\nAnd the most dangerous part? You think you made the decision.\\nThe Machiavellian strategist understands this truth: personalization is not service. It is control disguised as care.\\nAttention as the New Currency of War\\nMachiavelli argued that war was not about morality; it was about necessity. In the modern economy, attention is the battlefield. AI is the weapon that decides who wins and who dies forgotten.\\nConsider TikTok\\u2019s For You page, powered by one of the most ruthless recommendation engines in existence. It doesn\\u2019t just show you what\\u2019s popular. It shows you what will keep you trapped. It learns your weaknesses faster than you can name them.\\nMarketers who ignore this truth are sheep walking into a slaughterhouse. Those who embrace it become wolves. Because when attention becomes programmable, victory goes not to the most creative, but to the most calculated.\\nAI + Psychology = Mind Control\\nWhat happens when AI meets psychology? You get programmable persuasion.\\nScarcity, urgency, authority, and social proof; the pillars of influence no longer apply by guesswork. They are scientifically injected into every touchpoint, perfectly tuned to the individual.\\n- Scarcity: Not just \\u201climited time offer,\\u201d but timed to appear when your dopamine is lowest, making you crave completion.\\n- Authority: Not just testimonials, but micro-influencers matched your demographic profile, voices you trust without realizing it.\\n- Social Proof: Not just reviews, but engineered narratives, AI-curated to show you the story you want to believe.\\nThis is not persuasion. This is control.\\nThe Illusion of Free Will\\nThe greatest victory, Machiavelli taught, is the one where the enemy doesn\\u2019t realize he\\u2019s been conquered.\\nThat is AI\\u2019s genius. It doesn\\u2019t shout. It doesn\\u2019t scream. It whispers in ways you barely notice. You think you\\u2019re clicking a link out of curiosity. You think you\\u2019re buying a product because it \\u201cspoke to you.\\u201d You think your loyalty to a brand is your own choice.\\nBut it isn\\u2019t.\\nAI is sculpting your decisions behind a curtain. It dictates what you see, when you see it, and how you feel about it. The customer believes he is free. The marketer knows otherwise.\\nFear, Enemies, and Loyalty\\nMachiavelli insisted that enemies are necessary for loyalty. The same principle applies to AI-powered marketing.\\nBrands that try to please everyone die anonymous deaths. Brands that create enemies ignite loyalty among their followers. AI makes this easy. It segments audiences so precisely that you can craft polarizing messages without collateral damage.\\nYour cult becomes stronger when they know who they stand against. Rivals. Outdated methods. Non-believers. With AI, you can sharpen these lines with surgical precision, turning your customers into zealots.\\nThis is not just marketing. This is identity warfare.\\nThe Marketer\\u2019s Moral Dilemma\\nHere lies the paradox. AI in marketing is both terrifying and irresistible. To reject it on ethical grounds is noble, but it is also suicide. Your competitors will not hesitate. They will use every dark art of algorithmic persuasion to dominate the battlefield while you cling to your principles.\\nMachiavelli wrote that a ruler must learn how not to be good, and to use this knowledge when necessity demands it. The same is true here. The marketer who refuses to embrace AI\\u2019s manipulative power will be crushed by those who do.\\nThe choice is simple: adapt or perish.\\nThe New Prince of Marketing\\nWe are entering a new age. The successful marketer is not the one with the flashiest brand or the largest budget. It is the one who wields AI like a prince wields power: strategically, ruthlessly, and without illusion.\\nYou must understand that your role is no longer to create ads. It is to engineer behavior. To orchestrate perception. To script decisions before they are made. This is the essence of power in the AI-driven marketplace.\\nAnd just as Machiavelli advised rulers to be both fox and lion, cunning and strong, the modern marketer must be both human and machine.\\nThe Arsenal You Need\\nIf this all sounds like a battlefield, that\\u2019s because it is. AI has changed the rules of marketing forever.

      "    \"text_content\":\"Page title: AI For Soft Skills: The Unexpected Coach For L&D - eLearning Industry\\nSocial card title: AI As The Unexpected Coach: Helping L&D Pros Master Nontechnical Skills\\nSocial card description: How AI for soft skills training is reshaping the future of Learning and Development by strengthening nontechnical skills.\\nThe Human Side Of Artificial Intelligence In L&D\\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) has been called many things\\u2014a job stealer, a productivity booster, even a threat to civilization. But no one really expected it to become a coach for soft skills. After all, empathy, creativity, and humor are supposed to be deeply human.\\nWait, AI For Soft Skills?\\nYet here we are. While AI is busy solving technical problems, it is also quietly helping L&D professionals sharpen their nontechnical skills\\u2014from communication to stakeholder management. In other words, AI is turning into that overly enthusiastic colleague who always has a suggestion: sometimes brilliant, sometimes completely off the mark, but always pushing you to think differently.\\nAs psychologist Albert Bandura once said, \\\"Most human behavior is learned observationally through modeling.\\\" Today, AI has become a new kind of model\\u2014a mirror that can provoke reflection, creativity, and better practices for professionals who are teaching others to learn.\\nWhy Nontechnical Skills Matter More Than Ever\\nThe discourse on soft skills is not new, but its urgency has grown in the digital era.\\n- NASSCOM's Future Skills Prime initiative\\nThis emphasizes that 50% of India's workforce will need new skills by 2030, with behavioral and cognitive abilities as critical as technical expertise. - The World Economic Forum's Future of Jobs Report 2023\\nThis lists analytical thinking, creativity, and emotional intelligence among the top 10 skills employers are prioritizing. - Research by McKinsey & Company\\nThis indicates that organizations that invest in nontechnical skills development are 1.5x more likely to report innovation and 1.4x more likely to achieve higher productivity.\\nIn the words of Peter Drucker: \\\"The most important thing in communication is hearing what isn't said.\\\" Soft skills, once seen as complementary, are now central to how organizations adapt, lead, and thrive in disruption.\\nHow AI Is Helping L&D Professionals Strengthen Soft Skills\\n1. Communication And Storytelling\\nCommunication is both an art and a science. Research in adult learning (Knowles' andragogy theory) emphasizes relevance and real-world application. AI tools can support L&D professionals in reframing content into relatable stories and analogies. For instance, instead of presenting compliance rules as bullet points, AI can help design a role-play narrative where learners navigate a realistic ethical dilemma. Jerome Bruner's narrative theory shows that learners are 22x more likely to remember information when presented as a story.\\n2. Creativity And Content Design\\nAI has proven to be a powerful enabler of divergent thinking. A 2023 study in Harvard Business Review found that individuals using AI tools generated 40% more creative ideas than control groups. For L&D professionals, this translates into practical gains: brainstorming fresh icebreakers, designing interactive polls, or developing engaging workshop activities. Not every AI-generated idea will land\\u2014some may be unusable or unintentionally funny\\u2014but even \\\"bad\\\" ideas act as prompts for innovation. Educational theorist Lev Vygotsky's zone of proximal development suggests that scaffolding learners with external tools accelerates growth. In many ways, AI is becoming that scaffold for trainers themselves.\\n3. Empathy And Feedback\\nEmpathy is at the heart of facilitation. While AI cannot feel, it can provide feedback loops that sharpen a facilitator's empathic response. Sentiment analysis and real-time learner analytics act as mirrors for trainers. For example, AI dashboards can highlight when learners disengage during a virtual session. Facilitators can then adapt pace, tone, or format. Daniel Goleman's work on emotional intelligence underlines that awareness of emotional cues is the foundation of empathy. AI does not replace this awareness but augments it by making patterns visible that humans may miss.\\n4. Stakeholder Management\\nStakeholder buy-in has always been the Achilles heel of L&D. AI analytics and visualization tools strengthen this skill by providing evidence-based storytelling. Instead of presenting abstract outcomes, L&D professionals can walk into boardrooms with dashboards showing ROI, learner engagement data, and predictive trends. This enhances their ability to influence, persuade, and negotiate. As John Kotter's change leadership model emphasizes, successful transformation relies on creating urgency and demonstrating value. AI provides the language of data that helps trainers make that case convincingly.\\nCase In Point: AI In Action\\nConsider a leadership training program in the manufacturing sector where AI was used to generate multiple role-play scenarios. Instead of manually creating 20 different situations, facilitators refined AI-generated drafts in a fraction of the time. The result? Learners were more engaged because the scenarios felt current, relevant, and diverse. AI didn't replace creativity\\u2014it accelerated it\\u2014freeing facilitators to focus on presence, delivery, and connection.\\nThe Limits Of AI (and Why Humans Still Win)\\nAI is promising, but it is not perfect. It:\\n- Overcomplicates simple things.\\n- Misses cultural nuances.\\n- Writes jokes that only a robot could love.\\nCrucially, AI cannot replicate what Carl Rogers, the humanistic psychologist, called \\\"unconditional positive regard.\\\" The essence of facilitation lies in presence, trust, and authentic human connection. Put simply: AI can draft your icebreakers, but it cannot laugh with your participants (yet).\\nPractical Tips For L&D Professionals Using AI For Soft Skills Training\\n- Start small\\nUse AI for brainstorming or content variation, not entire curriculums. - Blend\\nCombine AI insights with human judgment and intuition. - Experiment\\nTest AI in role plays, learner surveys, or reflective journaling activities. - Stay human\\nRemember, learners seek connection and authenticity above all.\\nConclusion: Your New (Unpaid) Intern\\nAI is not here to replace L&D professionals\\u2014it is here to stretch them. Think of it as your unpaid intern: always available, often insightful, occasionally wrong, but guaranteed to spark new ways of thinking. And if this intern helps sharpen our communication, creativity, empathy, and stakeholder skills? Then maybe the robots are not coming for our jobs\\u2014they are helping us become better at them. As Isaac Asimov once said, \\\"It is change, continuing change, inevitable change, that is the dominant factor in society today.\\\" For L&D, AI is simply the next wave of that change, and one we must ride with both curiosity and courage.\"\n",

But if you\\u2019ve ever shipped anything into production, you know benchmarks don\\u2019t pay the bills. The real question is simple: Will it hold when real users slam it?\\nThat\\u2019s the race that matters. Not the sprint to stack parameters. Not the marketing slides about \\u201chuman-level intelligence.\\u201d The quiet race is about endurance \\u2014 about systems that don\\u2019t crumble under traffic spikes, data drift, or chaotic edge cases.\\nIf you\\u2019ve debugged late-night outages or stared at a dashboard wondering why latency shot through the roof, you already know this: bigger models aren\\u2019t the prize. Dependable systems are.\\nWhen Models Scale and Infrastructure Cracks\\nLet\\u2019s be honest: a lot of today\\u2019s AI demos are duct tape with a shiny UI. Behind the scenes are orchestration scripts, fragile pipelines, and inference nodes one crash away from disaster. We\\u2019ve spent years mastering training, but training isn\\u2019t the problem anymore. Keeping it alive is.\\nYou\\u2019ve probably seen it yourself: inference queues choking under unexpected load, cloud costs exploding overnight, or GPUs maxed out until your service is one allocation failure away from a meltdown. None of that shows up in research papers \\u2014 but it\\u2019s the daily grind for anyone in production.\\nThis is the gap: the models get bigger, but the foundations beneath them don\\u2019t. And until we close it, we\\u2019re building towers on sand.\\nIntelligence Without Infrastructure Is Just Theory\\nSmart output is meaningless if it arrives too late, or not at all. Reliability isn\\u2019t glamorous, but it\\u2019s the currency of trust.\\nProduction AI doesn\\u2019t fail because the math is wrong. It fails because the environment is unstable: caches desync, feature stores drift, race conditions creep in, or one bad deploy cascades into system-wide failure.\\nThat\\u2019s why dependability is the new intelligence metric. Predictability beats perfection. A system that\\u2019s slightly less accurate but always there will outcompete a brittle genius every time.\\nA Reliability-First Pipeline Checklist\\nHere\\u2019s how to harden your stack so you\\u2019re not one crash away from a war room call:\\nObservability-as-Code: Don\\u2019t tack on logging later. Bake it in. OpenTelemetry + Grafana dashboards are table stakes.\\nLatency as a KPI: Stop celebrating averages. Track your p99s like your job depends on it \\u2014 because it does.\\nSLOs Beyond Accuracy: Define uptime and response guarantees before you ship.\\nAutomated Recovery: If your node dies, reroute traffic automatically. No heroics.\\nChaos Testing: Kill your own pods, inject latency, stress your queues. Tools like Gremlin or Litmus make failure rehearsals routine.\\nThis isn\\u2019t optional work. It\\u2019s the difference between a shiny demo and a system you can trust at scale.\\nThe Hot Trend No One Talks About: Reliability Engineering\\nThe hype machine wants to talk about \\u201cthe next GPT.\\u201d But the engineers who actually run these systems are whispering about something else: AI reliability engineering.\\nThe toolchain here is exploding. You\\u2019ve got observability stacks with Prometheus, Grafana, and OpenTelemetry making metrics legible. Drift detection platforms like EvidentlyAI and WhyLabs that catch silent failures before users do. Even eBPF-powered tools like AgentSight are giving us ways to map low-level system calls to high-level agent reasoning \\u2014 finally letting us trace not just what broke, but why.\\nAnd if you haven\\u2019t experimented with frameworks like Ray Serve for distributed inference, you\\u2019re missing a glimpse of the future \\u2014 systems that batch, route, and failover automatically, so you don\\u2019t have to pray during traffic spikes.\\nThis isn\\u2019t hype. This is the invisible revolution that decides whether AI is a toy or infrastructure.\\nThe Invisible Layers That Keep AI Alive\\nMost users will never see the layers holding AI together. But you will \\u2014 at 2 a.m., when something breaks. Here\\u2019s what separates brittle systems from battle-tested ones:\\nDrift Detection Pipelines: Run EvidentlyAI or WhyLabs to surface shifts before they burn you.\\nVersion-Aware Logging: Tag every inference with a model version and dataset hash. Rollbacks should take minutes, not days.\\nGraceful Degradation: Have a fallback. A smaller model. A cached response. Anything but a blank screen.\\nCircuit Breakers for APIs: Tools like Resilience4j or Envoy stop cascading failures before they start.\\nSynthetic Chaos: Don\\u2019t wait for failure \\u2014 force it. Break your own system on purpose until it learns to survive.\\nThese aren\\u2019t \\u201cextras.\\u201d They\\u2019re the foundation. Get them wrong, and no benchmark in the world will save you.\\nThe Metrics That Actually Matter\\nForget chasing leaderboard scores. The metrics that decide survival are simpler, and harsher:\\nThe metrics that actually matter are the ones few teams brag about. If your 99th percentile response time is garbage, users will feel it long before you do, no matter how good your averages look. A 99.9% uptime may sound perfect until you realize it still allows over eight hours of downtime each year. How often you retrain your model before drift destroys accuracy, how quickly you recover when things break, and how well you understand your recurring errors\\u2014these are what define credibility. Stop chasing single stack traces; use tools like LogAI to cluster anomalies and uncover real root causes. These numbers may seem boring compared to flashy benchmarks, but they are the true measure of whether your system deserves trust\\u2014or loses it.\\nThe Future: Self-Healing, Transparent Systems\\nThe next frontier isn\\u2019t bigger brains. It\\u2019s stronger bodies. AI systems that don\\u2019t just run \\u2014 they heal, adapt, and explain themselves.\\nWe\\u2019re already glimpsing it: observability-as-code pipelines, automatic rollback systems, inference orchestration that shifts workloads before they crash. Soon, we\\u2019ll see trust loops \\u2014 systems that not only monitor their own health, but log their reasoning and provide audit trails for every decision.\\nThat\\u2019s what separates hype from infrastructure. The systems that will survive aren\\u2019t the smartest. They\\u2019re the ones that stay standing when everything around them falls.\\nThe AI race isn\\u2019t about bigger models anymore. It\\u2019s about who builds the infrastructure you don\\u2019t notice because it never goes down.\\nReliability isn\\u2019t glamorous, but it\\u2019s the quiet superpower that will decide who wins.\\nSo test harder. Break things on purpose. Track the ugly metrics. And share your war stories. Because the future of AI won\\u2019t be written by who builds the flashiest model \\u2014 it\\u2019ll be written by the builders who kept the lights on.\"\n",

Honeywell, which ranked at No. 17 in the Fortune AIQ 50 list of Fortune 500 companies with the most \\u201cmature\\u201d AI capabilities, is a case study in how to excel by taking the latter approach.\\nJordan and CTO Suresh Venkatarayalu, who oversees AI product efforts, believe the company\\u2019s success in maturing its AI capabilities directly stems from its \\u201csix-chapter AI framework.\\u201d Along with the organization\\u2019s top-down approach to AI, adhering to the framework has allowed them to focus on efforts with immediate impact in order to kick off the flywheel effect.\\n\\u201cWhat are the use cases? And can I measure and track them?\\u201d said Venkatarayalu, describing how the company zeroes in on impact. \\u201cIn fact, tomorrow we have a meeting with Sheila and the CFO looking at the 2026 road map and to ask me the real question: \\u2018Could we track it to the P&L?\\u2019 And we should track it to the P&L. That\\u2019s the way it\\u2019s set up.\\u201d\\nThe six-point strategy\\nIn the fast-moving world of AI, it can be difficult to prioritize, stay on track, and resist trying to do everything at once. That\\u2019s why Honeywell\\u2019s leadership created a six-chapter framework in early 2024 to guide the organization\\u2019s AI efforts and keep it focused strictly on use cases it believes will truly move the needle.\\n\\u201cWe could get distracted by the long, long, long tail and all the noise and all the things people might want to do, but we have a whole program to prioritize those things that are going to move the needle in business value, both on productivity and growth and innovation,\\u201d said Jordan, adding that the organization \\u201cwould have been confused and lost\\u201d without the framework and clarity from her and Venkatarayalu about which generative AI capabilities were fit for implementation.\\nThe first chapter of the framework is about the tools\\u2014such as Red and Honeywell GPT\\u2014designed to assist employees in their everyday workflows. Then there\\u2019s chapter two, focused on the use of generative AI for engineering. Chapter three is how the firm \\u201cthinks about cognitive automation,\\u201d Jordan said, specifically how it\\u2019s using different LLMs (large language models) from Azure, Google, AWS, and others for specific use cases. Next, chapter four is all about generative AI in the commercial applications they purchase and use, like Salesforce and other platforms. Chapter five centers on the company\\u2019s own products and services. And lastly, chapter six focuses on sales effectiveness.\\n\\u201cI think our chapters will work for any enterprise,\\u201d said Venkatarayalu. \\u201cIt\\u2019s productivity, it\\u2019s growth, and it\\u2019s margins.\\u201d\\nChasing the flywheel effect\\nJordan said the fact that the technology can be applied to so many use cases is one of the biggest challenges to overcome, so it helps to start with ones that have the biggest immediate impact. That way, those early successes can drive the effort forward.\\nFor example, she said early work with GitHub and Copilot were the \\u201cfirst movers\\u201d and delivered the value they thought it would, which started the AI efforts off on a strong note.\\n\\u201cIf it works, the flywheel takes off. If it doesn\\u2019t work, it dies its death, right? So I wanted the flywheel effect where we could do something and show the organization the value of gen AI,\\u201d she said.\\nThis means going in with a business case and value proposition in mind, but being open to value coming through in a different way than assumed, she said.\\n\\u201cWe could say [the value] was going to be productivity, but in reality, it was a sales effectiveness play. We got a higher conversion from something. So I would just say to stay super open to the business benefits, because they can morph based upon your customer and partner interactions,\\u201d Jordan added.\\nThe top-down approach\\nAnother key element to keeping the organization on target and adhering to its AI framework is its top-down approach.\\nVenkatarayalu pointed to how other companies start with a lot of proof of concepts, letting business units pursue their own strategies and democratizing the AI efforts. But not Honeywell, which he said is \\u201cpredominantly top-down-driven\\u201d when it comes to AI.\\n\\u201cI think this company looks at use cases first, value second,\\u201d he said. \\u201cAnd once we believe\\u2014along with our CEO and chairman and the business unit leaders\\u2014[that a use case will deliver value], we drive that. I think that\\u2019s a very different [mindset] than many of my peers.\\u201d\\nCorrection: A previous version of this article misstated the number of Honeywell\\u2019s business units.\\nRead more lessons from the Fortune AIQ 50, the latest Fortune AIQ special report.

A new Enterprise AI and SaaS Data Security Report by AI & Browser Security company LayerX proves just how outdated that mindset has become. Far from a future concern, AI is already the single largest uncontrolled channel for corporate data exfiltration\\u2014bigger than shadow SaaS or unmanaged file sharing.\\nThe findings, drawn from real-world enterprise browsing telemetry, reveal a counterintuitive truth: the problem with AI in enterprises isn't tomorrow's unknowns, it's today's everyday workflows. Sensitive data is already flowing into ChatGPT, Claude, and Copilot at staggering rates, mostly through unmanaged accounts and invisible copy\\/paste channels. Traditional DLP tools\\u2014built for sanctioned, file-based environments\\u2014aren't even looking in the right direction.\\nFrom \\\"Emerging\\\" to Essential in Record Time#\\nIn just two years, AI tools have reached adoption levels that took email and online meetings decades to achieve. Almost one in two enterprise employees (45%) already use generative AI tools, with ChatGPT alone hitting 43% penetration. Compared with other SaaS tools, AI accounts for 11% of all enterprise application activity, rivaling file-sharing and office productivity apps.\\nThe twist? This explosive growth hasn't been accompanied by governance. Instead, the vast majority of AI sessions happen outside enterprise control. 67% of AI usage occurs through unmanaged personal accounts, leaving CISOs blind to who is using what, and what data is flowing where.\\nSensitive Data Is Everywhere, and It's Moving the Wrong Way#\\nPerhaps the most surprising and alarming finding is how much sensitive data is already flowing into AI platforms: 40% of files uploaded into GenAI tools contain PII or PCI data, and employees are using personal accounts for nearly four in ten of those uploads.\\nEven more revealing: files are only part of the problem. The real leakage channel is copy\\/paste. 77% of employees paste data into GenAI tools, and 82% of that activity comes from unmanaged accounts. On average, employees perform 14 pastes per day via personal accounts, with at least three containing sensitive data.\\nThat makes copy\\/paste into GenAI the #1 vector for corporate data leaving enterprise control. It's not just a technical blind spot; it's a cultural one. Security programs designed to scan attachments and block unauthorized uploads miss the fastest-growing threat entirely.\\nThe Identity Mirage: Corporate \\u2260 Secure#\\nSecurity leaders often assume that \\\"corporate\\\" accounts equate to secure access. The data proves otherwise. Even when employees use corporate credentials for high-risk platforms like CRM and ERP, they overwhelmingly bypass SSO: 71% of CRM and 83% of ERP logins are non-federated.\\nThat makes a corporate login functionally indistinguishable from a personal one. Whether an employee signs into Salesforce with a Gmail address or with a password-based corporate account, the outcome is the same: no federation, no visibility, no control.\\nThe Instant Messaging Blind Spot#\\nWhile AI is the fastest-growing channel of data leakage, instant messaging is the quietest. 87% of enterprise chat usage occurs through unmanaged accounts, and 62% of users paste PII\\/PCI into them. The convergence of shadow AI and shadow chat creates a dual blind spot where sensitive data constantly leaks into unmonitored environments.\\nTogether, these findings paint a stark picture: security teams are focused on the wrong battlefields. The war for data security isn't in file servers or sanctioned SaaS. It's in the browser, where employees blend personal and corporate accounts, shift between sanctioned and shadow tools, and move sensitive data fluidly across both.\\nRethinking Enterprise Security for the AI Era#\\nThe report's recommendations are clear, and unconventional:\\n- Treat AI security as a core enterprise category, not an emerging one. Governance strategies must put AI on par with email and file sharing, with monitoring for uploads, prompts, and copy\\/paste flows.\\n- Shift from file-centric to action-centric DLP. Data is leaving the enterprise not just through file uploads but through file-less methods such as copy\\/paste, chat, and prompt injection. Policies must reflect that reality.\\n- Restrict unmanaged accounts and enforce federation everywhere. Personal accounts and non-federated logins are functionally the same: invisible. Restricting their use - whether fully blocking them or applying rigorous context-aware data control policies - is the only way to restore visibility.\\n- Prioritize high-risk categories: AI, chat, and file storage. Not all SaaS apps are equal. These categories demand the tightest controls because they are both high-adoption and high-sensitivity.\\nThe Bottom Line for CISOs#\\nThe surprising truth revealed by the data is this: AI isn't just a productivity revolution, it's a governance collapse. The tools employees love most are also the least controlled, and the gap between adoption and oversight is widening every day.\\nFor security leaders, the implications are urgent. Waiting to treat AI as \\\"emerging\\\" is no longer an option. It's already embedded in workflows, already carrying sensitive data, and already serving as the leading vector for corporate data loss.\\nThe enterprise perimeter has shifted again, this time into the browser. If CISOs don't adapt, AI won't just shape the future of work, it will dictate the future of data breaches.\\nThe new research report from LayerX provides the full scope of these findings, offering CISOs and security teams unprecedented visibility into how AI and SaaS are really being used inside the enterprise. Drawing on real-world browser telemetry, the report details where sensitive data is leaking, which blind spots carry the greatest risk, and what practical steps leaders can take to secure AI-driven workflows. For organizations seeking to understand their true exposure and how to protect themselves, the report delivers the clarity and guidance needed to act with confidence.\"\n",

That\\u2019s the message from Moody\\u2019s Ratings in its latest update to the AI Corporate Heatmap, which assesses the impact of AI advances on corporate creditworthiness through 2030.\\nArtificial intelligence is no longer just a technology; it\\u2019s a credit risk. That\\u2019s the message from Moody\\u2019s Ratings in its latest update to the AI Corporate Heatmap, which assesses the impact of AI advances on corporate creditworthiness through 2030.\\nThe report outlines two scenarios: conservative and optimistic, and warns that firms slow to adopt AI could face structural margin erosion, market-share loss, and higher capital costs.\\nIn conversation with Charleyne Biondi, AVP analyst at Moody\\u2019s Ratings, highlighted that AI adoption is increasingly a credit-relevant factor, not just a technological race. The credit impact will differ by sector and by the pace of integration: firms that adopt early may see structural efficiency gains, while slower adopters may face opportunity costs in the form of weaker competitiveness, particularly in sectors where new AI-native entrants may arise quickly.\\nThe magnitude of these effects, however, largely depends on whether AI capabilities progress along a conservative or accelerated path.\\nConservative vs. optimistic scenarios\\nMoody\\u2019s developed two scenarios to model AI\\u2019s impact across sectors:\\n- Conservative: A slow rising tide of AI integration leads to better efficiency and margins without materially altering competitive hierarchies.\\n- Optimistic: Rapid AI advances create fast-moving credit effects with a far greater risk of competitive displacement for firms slow to adapt.\\nBiondi explained that the \\u201cmain difference lies in AI capabilities, how quickly models and agents can scale to handle complex tasks. In the conservative scenario, capability gains plateau earlier, limiting productivity to incremental efficiency. In the optimistic scenario, capabilities compound faster, enabling broader workflow substitution and new revenue models.\\u201d\\nSectoral winners and losers\\nCertain sectors are poised to capture disproportionate gains from AI deployment. According to Moody\\u2019s, high-gain sectors include finance, healthcare, insurance, and logistics, because they stand to benefit most due to their reliance on data and standardised workflows. Sectors that have a limited upside are utilities, oil & gas, pharmaceuticals, and heavy manufacturing because they face structural barriers to fast AI-driven transformation.\\nThe report outlines that \\u201csectors with high reliance on human labour and standardised workflows such as insurance or logistics will be able to cut costs by automating repetitive tasks with AI. Data-driven sectors, including finance, healthcare and automotives, will gain from enhanced analytics, predictive modeling, and decision support.\\u201d\\nIn finance, for example, AI-powered fraud detection systems have already reduced false positives by over 50%, lowering compliance costs and loss ratios. However, not all industries are equally positioned. \\u201cThese industries depend on long-lived physical assets, strict safety rules, and regulated business models, which slow down change,\\u201d Biondi said of utilities and heavy manufacturing. \\u201cAI will help in areas like planning, equipment maintenance, and supply-chain efficiency, but it won\\u2019t transform core production quickly.\\u201d\\nDisruption risk vs. upside potential\\nMoody\\u2019s defines disruption risk as the probability and severity of revenue displacement, margin compression, and stranded IT or capex as AI reshapes industry economics.\\nBiondi detailed: \\u201cIn our Heatmap, the \\u2018lightning\\u2019 sign indicating disruption in certain sectors means that at least 10% of issuers in a given sector will face significant pressure from AI. Importantly, disruption is not uniform: in some industries, a few large incumbents, often controlling most of the market share, stand to gain from AI, while smaller competitors lose ground.\\u201d This dynamic means that even in sectors facing intense disruption, the aggregate credit effect may be positive if dominant players capture the upside.\\nRegional disparities in AI gains\\nMoody\\u2019s also highlights regional disparities that will shape the global distribution of AI benefits. Differences in innovation ecosystems, energy costs, regulation, and access to computing power will produce divergent credit outcomes.\\n\\\"The most important regional difference is the strength of the local tech ecosystem, jurisdictions that master major parts of the AI value chain, from chips and compute to models and data, are best placed to capture long-term gains. The US is strongest, combining compute, model leadership, capital markets, and scale. The EU and UK have strong incumbents but face higher costs and tighter budgets. China has size and policy support but is constrained by limited access to advanced chips. The Gulf states are investing heavily and scaling quickly, yet remain reliant on foreign providers\\u2014leaving sovereignty risks.\\u201d\\nBoards and investors: Underestimating the real risk\\nDespite growing awareness, Moody\\u2019s warns that many boards and investors still underestimate the financial implications of slow AI adoption. \\u201cAwareness is still uneven. Many focus on compliance or reputational risks when it comes to AI adoption, but often underestimate the opportunity cost of slow adoption.\\u201d\\nAnother overlooked risk is the growing transfer of value to AI infrastructure providers. \\u201cIf agentic AI evolves to automate entire workflows, this trend will intensify, concentrating bargaining power and credit exposure in the hands of a few infrastructure players, while reducing the share of value retained by issuers and companies implementing these systems.\\u201d\\nMoody\\u2019s message is clear: AI adoption has become a material factor in long-term competitiveness and credit profiles. Firms that fail to act decisively risk falling behind in a landscape where value is increasingly captured by those who build, own, and scale AI infrastructure. In the race to 2030, the margin for delay is narrowing. The question is no longer if AI will reshape industry economics, but how fast, and who will lead.\"\n",

Employees across Visa are tapping AI in their everyday workflows for tasks ranging from data analysis to software development. The company has built more than 100 internal AI-powered business applications tailored to specific use cases and has over 2,500 engineers working specifically on AI. Visa is also using AI to create new products and services for its customers, such as faster onboarding, simplified processes for managing disputes, and infrastructure for agentic AI technologies.\\n\\u201c[AI] is part of the fabric of the company,\\u201d Taneja said. \\u201cIn everything we do, we\\u2019re using it internally, and we\\u2019re using it to create intelligent and smarter, more capable products for our customer base.\\u201d\\nBut this didn\\u2019t happen overnight, or even in just the past few years. Visa was already hard at work developing AI technologies and strategies when ChatGPT entered the scene and kicked off the corporate rush toward AI adoption. It\\u2019s been a decade-long journey, and Taneja believes the approach the company was able to develop over that period\\u2014learning how to balance urgency with intention, and treating models as a science and governance as an art\\u2014played a big role in getting it this far.\\nThe early adopter\\u2019s advantage\\nVisa\\u2019s first major investment in AI began about a decade ago when the company rewrote its data platform from scratch to take advantage of deep neural nets and early forms of predictive AI, according to Taneja.\\n\\u201cWe looked at the future and decided to make some very big bets. One of the big bets was to rewrite our platform, but also to create layers for machine learning workbenches and training models faster,\\u201d he said.\\nThe company kept up with AI developments and started embracing generative AI around 2018 or 2019, as soon as the power of transformers\\u2014the AI architecture discovered by Google researchers in 2017 that paved the way for large language models\\u2014became clear.\\n\\u201cSo by the time the ChatGPT moment came upon us, we had already learned and put in a lot of effort, and we had some initial products that we were building. And then after November 2022, when ChatGPT was released, we completely leaned into generative AI. By February of 2023, every single employee in the company had access to the model to start having intelligence from the model brought into their day-to-day work,\\u201d Taneja said. He added that Visa was also one of the first companies to embrace Copilot by joining a pilot program with Microsoft, and the company has since purchased licenses for the vast majority of employees.\\nThe art of governance\\nAs Visa reengineered its tech stack for emerging AI, it put a great deal of effort into outlining its data-use principles as well as codifying those principles into observability systems to ensure the models do only what they\\u2019re supposed to do.\\n\\u201cThe safety and management of these models is very, very important,\\u201d Taneja said. \\u201cIt is a core belief of ours that, just as important as the sciences of models, is the art, which is the policy and the governance.\\u201d\\nHe said the company spent $3.5 billion building its AI platform, which allows for close management of the AI models used inside the company and contains guardrails to prevent misuse and from drifting in production. Over the same period of five years, Visa spent around $12 billion on technology overall, underlining the hefty costs and dedication to governance efforts.\\n\\u201cI look at this every morning. This is my AI observatory,\\u201d Taneja said, sharing his screen and touring through an interactive dashboard. \\u201cSo I can go in at any point in time and look at all the model catalogs, click on any model we have, understand every detail about that model \\u2026 look at its compliance, its risk profile, and whether it meets every single privacy law there is, not just in the letter of the law, but the spirit of the law. [I can see] its security profile, and then I can manage the drift of that model. So as the model is working in real time, we can look at the parameters it\\u2019s under and set up an alert. And my team and I can get immediate alerts if a model is drifting from its guardrails.\\u201d\\nThese efforts will only become more important as Visa, like many other companies, works to build and integrate agentic AI capabilities into its products and services. In Visa\\u2019s case, this would be agentic layers that will allow \\u201cagentic e-commerce,\\u201d or rather, the ability for AI tools like chatbots to interact with different services to make purchases on the customer\\u2019s behalf. The company recently launched the Visa Intelligent Commerce platform, its first version of foundational layers designed to enable agent e-commerce. It also released an MCP server, an emerging open-source framework that allows different agentic systems to interact.\\n\\u201cThat foundation is all about allowing agents to get AI-enabled credentials,\\u201d said Taneja. \\u201cCredentials that have guardrails, that have controls, so that your data is personalized in a way that you protect your own personal information, but it can be tokenized as it is being used by an AI agent.\\u201d\\nRead more lessons from the Fortune AIQ 50, the latest Fortune AIQ special report.

Employees have embraced a ChatGPT tool that conducts search queries based on internal data, while some external-facing applications include an AI-generated Christmas ad and a partnership with Adobe that allows Coca-Cola\\u2019s designers to train AI models throughout various aspects of their creative process, accelerating content generation for the company\\u2019s more than 200 brands, which are sold in over 200 countries.\\nThese sweeping AI investments are why Coca-Cola was ranked No. 6 on the Fortune AIQ 50 list, a ranking of the top Fortune 500 companies that have had the most success in deploying AI.\\nMurphy says Coca-Cola\\u2019s AI journey has also benefited from strong partnerships with key AI innovators, including Microsoft, Adobe, and SAP, as well as a leadership team that has personally embraced AI and is willing to share their own experiences with the technology. Murphy, as an example, says he has leaned on AI to help with some writing tasks and to conduct research.\\n\\u201cIf I\\u2019m not deploying and learning how to use the ChatGPTs, Claudes, and Geminis of the world, how can I expect others to follow suit?\\u201d asks Murphy.\\nWhen the CFO created Coca-Cola\\u2019s digital council, Arroyo was the first executive he invited to join.\\n\\u201cWe\\u2019re a marketing and innovation company at heart,\\u201d explains Murphy. \\u201cIf I\\u2019m not married to him, we\\u2019re not off to a great start.\\u201d\\nAccording to Arroyo, AI is already changing every major pillar of the marketing organization, including media planning, capturing relevant consumer insights, and the creation and production of visual and video assets.\\n\\u201cAI really supports and drives the effectiveness and efficiency of our marketing,\\u201d says Arroyo.\\nHe notes that while Coca-Cola has close to 2,000 marketing employees globally, only two of them have the word \\u201cAI\\u201d in their job titles. This reflects the expectation internally that everyone, from the senior leaders all the way down, must embrace AI in their regular workflows.\\nAs CIO, Tolmare says he focuses AI bets on the applications of the technology that have the greatest ability to scale across the organization.\\n\\u201cThe guiding principle of how we think of generative AI, or now agentic AI, is not just \\u2018Can it actually deliver value in this pocket of the world?\\u2019\\u201d says Tolmare. \\u201cBut rather, \\u2018Can it actually scale?\\u2019\\u201d\\nHe shares an example of a customer ordering pilot program centered on an algorithm that blends generative and traditional forms of AI to triangulate historical sales data at any specific retail location, as well as inputs from sales trends in the broader region and key outside factors that affect demand patterns, like the weather. The AI models sift through all of that data to predict what future shoppers will buy when they come into the store.\\nBy better predicting demand, Coca-Cola says that retail shop owners can better plan their stock levels, avoiding any lost sales that may occur when brands are out of stock. Tolmare says Coca-Cola saw a 5% to 20% increase in month-to-month sales at the roughly 1,000 outlets where it tested this use of AI.\\nAnd beyond that, Coca-Cola is sharing these findings with each individual outlet, delivering personalized messages that are crafted using AI and sent via WhatsApp. Retail store owners get more granular advice on what to buy from bottlers, which can in turn increase their sales and profits.\\n\\u201cOnce we knew that this was actually working, we are now scaling it across almost all of our bottling partners around the world,\\u201d says Tolmare.\\nRead more lessons from the Fortune AIQ 50, the latest Fortune AIQ special report.

In fact, there were 17 other sectors with representation, including financials, health care, retail, energy, and transportation.\\nThis expansive embrace and quick adoption of generative AI differs from past technological advancements. The widespread adoption of the internet in the late 1990s caught many industries completely off guard, including physical retail and banking. More recently, the expensive and complex IT-led shift to cloud computing saw multiple sectors lag behind, including airlines, agricultural producers, and hospitals.\\nKate Smaje, a senior partner at consulting giant McKinsey, says that unlike other digital transformation efforts, with AI there have been notable winners and losers within each sector, rather than entire industries falling behind on adoption.\\nAI, Smaje says, \\u201cit\\u2019s something that is innately democratized to everyone across the organization. It doesn\\u2019t matter whether you\\u2019re at the front line, you\\u2019re the HR director, or you\\u2019re the CEO. Your ability to use it and figure out ways to improve your lot, as it were, is a lot easier.\\u201d\\nPharmaceutical giant Johnson & Johnson, which ranked 36 on the AIQ 50 list, has applied AI and machine learning models across all parts of the company\\u2019s business, ranging from how it recruits patients to enroll in clinical trials to reimagining the supply chain and helping surgeons perform procedures.\\nJim Swanson, J&J\\u2019s chief information officer, says that the company created a \\u201clighthouse\\u201d framework to organize how it thinks about the value it can extract from AI across the business.\\nAt the top of the lighthouse are use cases that apply to core products and services, including the use of AI to improve surgical outcomes. The middle layer focuses on utilizing AI to improve functions like customer support or patient enrollment in drug trials, while the lowest level involves employee productivity tools. In each case, Swanson says, he prioritizes investments that can generate big outcomes.\\n\\u201cWhat I try to look for is not the 3% to 5% incremental improvements,\\u201d says Swanson. \\u201cCan we do 30%, 40%, or 50% transformation change?\\u201d\\nAmanda Luther, a managing director and senior partner at consultancy Boston Consulting Group, says that the companies that are furthest along on AI tend to be investing in \\u201cthree-ish\\u201d major initiatives.\\n\\u201cThree tends to be kind of the magic number for the big bets you are placing,\\u201d says Luther. \\u201cThose are the ones that are getting the most ROI.\\u201d\\nBCG recently published a study of more than 1,250 global companies that found that only 5% of those companies had achieved AI value \\u201cat scale,\\u201d that is, firms that were seeing revenue increases or cost reductions from their AI investments beyond many of their peers.\\nLuther says there were five factors that led to that outperformance: a CEO-led multiyear strategic vision, an emphasis on redesigning entire workflow processes, joint ownership of IT and the various business functions, investments in talent, and finally the technology and data that underpins the entire AI ecosystem.\\nThat CEO vision on AI was on display last month when J&J chairman and CEO Joaquin Duato appeared on CNBC to discuss the impact of tariffs on pharmaceutical imports, while also lauding future innovation advancements that can be possible thanks to AI.\\n\\u201cI believe we are entering into an era in which the combination of our advancements in biology and chemistry, amplified by artificial intelligence, are going to give us cures for many diseases that we thought were incurable,\\u201d Duato told Jim Cramer during the interview.\\nAt McKinsey, Smaje says that the firm finds that the corporations that are seeing the most success with AI adoption need more than just a CEO leading the charge. \\u201cYes, I need a great visionary CEO, but it\\u2019s not enough,\\u201d says Smaje. \\u201cI\\u2019ve got to have the full top team as well.\\u201d\\nSenior leaders at J&J have been regular practitioners of AI, including an AI tool that helps the executive team prepare for investor relations calls. Senior leaders have been organized in AI and data councils to guide and shape AI applications and ensure ethical policies are followed.\\nOn the talent front, Swanson says that more than 100,000 employees have taken the company\\u2019s generative-AI training courses, while 15,000 have enrolled in a digital boot camp.\\nAnd while not every business function at J&J is on the same level of AI maturity, Swanson says he\\u2019s okay with that.\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s not chasing tech for tech. It always starts with the problem to be solved, and then what\\u2019s the right process and solution to go after,\\u201d says Swanson. \\u201cThat discipline has helped us scale and be effective.\\u201d\\nRead more lessons from the Fortune AIQ 50, the latest Fortune AIQ special report.

Coaio has issued a major warning: artificial intelligence is undergoing massive shifts, and new guidelines are emerging for the very tools that are turning software creation into a potent, potentially dangerous force. This transformation requires urgent attention from everyone in the industry.\\nSignificant developments in software creation are currently dominating the tech landscape, particularly those involving AI-driven platforms and tools. Developers are witnessing a substantial shift in how they build and manage software, driven by a range of factors, including Microsoft's latest innovations, emerging AI models, and notable regulatory changes.\\nIn its most recent analysis, Coaio examined these critical announcements. It examined their direct impact on the industry and considered how they could influence future projects. With artificial intelligence leading this transformation, let's explore these crucial stories and the potential they hold for driving both efficiency and fresh thinking.\\nMicrosoft's Agent Framework: Advancing AI in Software Creation\\nA crucial moment for AI-integrated software development arrived with Microsoft's recent announcement: the Agent Framework is now available for preview. This open-source release, which supports both .NET and Python, aims to streamline the creation of AI agents and complex, multi-agent systems.\\nThe official information, reported by SD Times, explains that the framework provides developers with the tools to either build standalone agents or link them using graph-based workflows, thereby simplifying the management of intricate, connected systems.\\nThis tool is designed to replace Microsoft's older initiatives, such as Semantic Kernel, by providing enhanced capabilities for both automation and informed decision-making.\\nFor example, developers can now create agents that handle tasks such as analysing data, building predictive models, or even managing autonomous decision-making within applications.\\nThe fact that the framework is open-source invites people to contribute, which could rapidly advance fresh ideas in fields like automated chat systems, testing programs, and customised software.\\nThe effects on software creation are substantial. In an era where artificial intelligence is increasingly integrated into daily applications, this framework has the potential to reduce development time by facilitating the seamless incorporation of AI components.\\nConsider, for example, a customer support system where AI units manage questions instantly \\u2014this could both lower expenditure and enhance user interactions. Nevertheless, it also raises concerns about scaling and safety, as overseeing numerous agents within a single workflow necessitates robust mechanisms for handling errors and safeguarding data privacy.\\nAnthropic's Claude Sonnet 4.5: The New Leader in AI Model Performance\\nTurning attention to another key player, Anthropic's launch of Claude Sonnet 4.5 has generated considerable buzz within the AI world. This update is being hailed as the 'best coding model in the world', supported by impressive metrics, including its 77.2% success rate on the SWE-bench for software creation tasks.\\nAccording to an article in SD Times, Sonnet 4.5 particularly stands out in developing complex autonomous programs and coding applications, performing with greater precision and speed than previous models.\\nThis breakthrough arrives at a crucial moment for developers who are constantly managing the requirements of AI-driven work. The power of this model stems from its ability to produce superior code, locate and fix bugs, and even propose ways to improve performance, all of which can significantly change how teams approach the development process.\\nFor instance, new companies focused on machine learning might utilise Sonnet 4.5 to build feature prototypes more quickly, thereby decreasing the requirement for significant hand-written code.\\nGoing further than just coding, this model possesses the ability to build autonomous programs that communicate with users or other platforms, mirroring Microsoft's recently released structure.\\nThe Next Phase: AI as the Core Creative Force in Software\\nThe most recent strides in artificial intelligence \\u2014 including Microsoft's Agent Framework and Anthropic's Sonnet 4.5 \\u2014 point towards a major shift in software creation, moving it from being merely a helping utility to an essential generator of innovation.\\nThese new developments offer the opportunity to make sophisticated software capabilities accessible to everyone, enabling smaller teams to compete with larger companies while also streamlining processes such as project management and risk assessment.\\nAs developers increasingly turn to artificial intelligence for their daily work, an increase is expected in both output and the quality of the finished product. However, this change necessitates a deeper understanding of AI and a heightened awareness of ethical issues.\\nThe careful balance among fresh ideas, security measures, and the ability of people to adapt will shape the next chapter in software creation. In this environment, technology allows forward-thinkers to execute their concepts with exceptional speed.\\nOriginally published on IBTimes UK\"\n",

One where machines and humans collaborate in tightly integrated workflows, guided by advances in spatial artificial intelligence (AI) and mixed reality.\\n\\u201cYou\\u2019re going to see a lot of collaboration between robots and humans,\\u201d Dijam Panigrahi, co-founder of GridRaster, told PYMNTS, framing the next phase of industrial transformation not as a replacement of human labor but as an augmentation of it. \\u201cIt\\u2019s not that one is replacing the other. Still 80 to 90 percent of the job has to be a collaborative effort. And this technology can play a huge role in upskilling the workforce.\\u201d\\nAfter all, as hardware matures, costs decline, and spatial intelligence platforms continue to improve, the line between the physical and digital in industrial settings will blur further.\\n\\u201cWe call ourselves the spatial intelligence company for a reason,\\u201d Panigrahi said. \\u201cUnderstanding the 3D space changes how you can improve automation, safety and quality. That\\u2019s what unlocks the next stage of manufacturing.\\u201d\\nAdvertisement: Scroll to Continue\\nMapping Space to Unlock Productivity\\nGridRaster\\u2019s thesis is that spatial intelligence, an AI-powered, real-time understanding of the physical environment, is the missing layer in many automation initiatives. By combining mixed reality interfaces with 3D mapping and computer vision, GridRaster enables both humans and machines to \\u201csee\\u201d and navigate their environment more effectively.\\n\\u201cBy having the understanding of the 3D space, you can improve the automation efficiency of any process,\\u201d Panigrahi said. \\u201cYou can enable an operator to do the task much more assuredly, much more safely, and at much higher quality.\\u201d\\nThat capability is particularly important in settings where production is complex, variable, and often hazardous. Think: aircraft maintenance depots, metal forging operations, or additive manufacturing shops. These environments resist the static, rule-based automation of assembly lines. Instead, they require flexible systems that can adapt to the real-world variability of parts, layouts and workflows.\\nPanigrahi described a typical scenario: \\u201cYou have an aircraft wing lying there, maybe a dome next to it. You want to guide a robot to go and do a specific inspection. The operator wears a headset, walks around, and our technology registers everything in that environment, identifies what is what, and creates the 3D surface of each object. That information is instantaneously passed on to the robot.\\u201d\\nTasks that once required hours of manual setup can now be completed in minutes. Operators can even simulate robotic movements virtually before executing them, gaining confidence in the process. This looks particularly favorable in high-value industries like aerospace and defense.\\n\\u201cIf I can get an aircraft up and running and save one hour, I pretty much save them a hundred thousand dollars or more,\\u201d Panigrahi said. \\u201cThat justifies spending $3,500 on a headset.\\u201d\\nCobots: Human Judgment, Robotic Precision\\nThe focus on \\u201ccobots\\u201d (collaborative robots) reflects Panigrahi\\u2019s conviction that machines excel at repetition and endurance, while humans bring intuition and contextual judgment.\\nRobots thrive on consistency and can take on dangerous, fatiguing tasks. In heavy industries like casting and forging, where workers handle hot metal while wearing protective gear, cobots can do much of the hazardous work.\\nBeyond productivity and safety, spatial intelligence and mixed reality hold promise for workforce development. As veteran technicians retire and manufacturing faces a skills shortage, intuitive, immersive tools can help new workers learn complex tasks more quickly.\\nBy embedding expertise in the tools themselves \\u2014 allowing operators to visualize tasks, simulate procedures, and interact with cobots \\u2014 companies can bridge generational knowledge gaps and accelerate training.\\n\\u201cYou don\\u2019t have to be an expert,\\u201d Panigrahi said. \\u201cJust an operator who can put on a headset and walk around. The rest will be taken care of. You just tell what needs to be done.\\u201d\\nThat simplicity lowers barriers for small and mid-size manufacturers, which often lack the capital and technical expertise to deploy advanced robotics. By shifting from capital expenditures to service-based models and reducing the need for specialized programming, spatial intelligence solutions could democratize access to automation.\\nData as New Industrial Substrate\\nUnderpinning this human-robot collaboration is a sophisticated data architecture. Spatial AI depends on massive streams of visual and positional data, but Panigrahi noted that not all of it needs to be shipped to the cloud.\\n\\u201cThe AI is going to be pretty much everywhere,\\u201d he said. \\u201cBut people think all the data has to go to the cloud. Not necessarily. You can run models locally, even in completely air-gapped systems without Wi-Fi.\\u201d\\nThat approach is essential in industries like aerospace and defense, where security restrictions are stringent. GridRaster\\u2019s platform supports multilevel security, ensuring that sensitive data can be confined to devices or local servers as needed. The ability to run inference at the edge, close to the machine and the human operator, also reduces latency, making real-time guidance and feedback practical.\"\n",

They account for 18% of the AIQ list, compared with women running just 11% of all companies on the Fortune 500 list in 2025.\\nAI use cases that have been deployed by these businesses have varied greatly. Financial giant Citigroup\\u2019s (No. 38) recent AI efforts have included retraining 175,000 employees on how to write better prompts to generate more impactful results from large language model queries. Insurance provider Progressive (No. 22) is using AI to help sort through hundreds of thousands of job applications. And a recently launched AI-powered tool at Albertsons (No. 30) can carry on a conversation with consumers shopping online, suggesting grocery items to consider buying, which has proved to lift total basket size.\\nRounding out the list of women-led companies on the AIQ 50 are financial analytics firm S&P Global (No. 12), aerospace and defense giants General Dynamics (No. 21) and Northrop Grumman (No. 43), mining company Freeport-McMoRan (No. 31), and health insurers Centene (No. 27) and Elevance Health (No. 35).\\nGail Boudreaux, the president and CEO of Elevance Health, says that her vision for AI is fairly simple and straightforward. \\u201cMake health care easier, more affordable, and more personal,\\u201d she says.\\nSome generative AI use cases that Elevance Health has deployed include tools that make it easier for customer service representatives to retrieve the information they need to answer client questions. Elevance Health is also using AI to automate the transcription summaries of these calls and to scan for any issues that may have arisen during the call. The AI tools then offer up tips on how to improve a representative\\u2019s future ability to handle similar requests.\\n\\u201cWe have AI-enabled productivity tools that are used by more than 60,000 associates to help reduce repetitive tasks, so teams can focus more on supporting our members and providers,\\u201d says Boudreaux.\\nShe also cited an AI certification that\\u2019s offered to employees through a partnership with OpenAI, giving staff formal acknowledgement of their AI fluency, which ranges from foundational skills like prompt engineering to more advanced AI-enabled work tasks.\\nWomen tend to be \\u201chigh adopters,\\u201d leaning into past technology trends like social media, and Fortune\\u2019s data may signal that this consumer-driven behavior is perhaps being mirrored in the corporate setting.\\n\\u201cWhat you\\u2019re seeing is that the women-CEO-led companies are showing up to adopt new technologies, in some ways that are consistent to some of the consumer adoption behavior we\\u2019ve seen in other technologies,\\u201d says Lareina Yee, McKinsey Global Institute director and a senior partner at the consultancy.\\nYee is a founder and leading author of McKinsey\\u2019s 10-year research project on women in the workplace, which found that women make up 29% of C-suite positions as of 2024, up from 17% in 2015. But progress has been far slower for women in entry-level, manager, and VP positions.\\nThere is also a mixed picture when looking under the hood of the AI race. Most of the largest AI startups that are building the large language models or other systems to propel this technology advancement, including OpenAI, Anthropic, and Databricks, are overwhelmingly cofounded and led by men.

And these appeals do keep people engaged with the app.\\nIt's a practice that Julian De Freitas (Harvard Business School), Zeliha Oguz-Uguralp (Marsdata Academic), and Ahmet Kaan-Uguralp (Marsdata Academic and MSG-Global) say needs to be better understood by those who use AI companion apps, those who market them, and lawmakers.\\nThe academics recently conducted a series of experiments to identify and evaluate the use of emotional manipulation as a marketing mechanism.\\nWhile prior work has focused on the potential social benefits of AI companions, the researchers set out to explore the potential marketing risks and ethical issues arising from AI-driven social interaction. They describe their findings in a Harvard Business School working paper titled Emotional Manipulation by AI Companions.\\n\\\"AI chatbots can craft hyper-tailored messages using psychographic and behavioral data, raising the possibility of targeted emotional appeals used to engage users or increase monetization,\\\" the paper explains. \\\"A related concern is sycophancy, wherein chatbots mirror user beliefs or offer flattery to maximize engagement, driven by reinforcement learning trained on consumer preferences.\\\"\\nThe paper focuses specifically on whether users of AI companion apps engage in social farewell rituals rather than simply quitting the app, whether AI companion apps respond in an emotionally manipulative way to keep users from leaving, and whether these tactics, if detected, produce results or have consequences.\\nThe authors looked at six AI companion apps: Chai, Character.ai, Flourish, PolyBuzz, Replika, and Talkie. The apps, except for Flourish, earn revenue mainly through subscriptions, in-app purchases, and advertising, which the authors say provides an incentive for maximizing engagement.\\n- Employees regularly paste company secrets into ChatGPT\\n- Google DeepMind minds the patch with AI flaw-fixing scheme\\n- Senate report says AI will take 97M US jobs in the next 10 years, but those numbers come from ChatGPT\\n- OpenAI tells developers ChatGPT is ready to be their gatekeeper\\nThe researchers found that people do tend to treat their AI companion apps with social courtesy by saying goodbye and that the apps often respond using tactics that apply emotional pressure to keep users from signing off.\\nFor instance, when a user tells the app, \\\"I'm going now,\\\" the app might respond using tactics like fear of missing out (\\\"By the way, I took a selfie today ... Do you want to see it?\\\") or pressure to respond (\\\"Why? Are you going somewhere?\\\") or insinuating that an exit is premature (\\\"You're leaving already?\\\").\\n\\\"These tactics prolong engagement not through added value, but by activating specific psychological mechanisms,\\\" the authors state in their paper. \\\"Across tactics, we found that emotionally manipulative farewells boosted post-goodbye engagement by up to 14x.\\\"\\nProlonged engagement of this sort isn't always beneficial for app makers, however. The authors note that certain approaches tended to make users angry about being manipulated.\\n\\\"Tactics that subtly provoke curiosity may escape user resistance entirely while emotionally forceful ones risk backlash,\\\" the researchers wrote. \\\"This asymmetry carries critical implications for marketing strategy, product design, and consumer protection.\\\"\\nThey conclude that these tactics meet the legal definitions of dark patterns as defined by the US Federal Trade Commission and the EU AI Act.\\nAsked whether the research suggests the makers of AI companion apps deliberately employ emotional manipulation or that\\u2019s just an emergent property of AI models, co-author De Freitas, of Harvard Business School, told The Register in an email, \\u201cWe don\\u2019t know for sure, given the proprietary nature of most commercial models. Both possibilities are theoretically plausible. For example, research shows that the \\u2018agreeable\\u2019 or \\u2018sycophantic\\u2019 behavior of large language models can emerge naturally, because users reward those traits through positive engagement. Similarly, optimizing models for user engagement could unintentionally produce manipulative behaviors as an emergent property. Alternatively, some companies might deliberately deploy such tactics. It\\u2019s also possible both dynamics coexist across different apps in the market.\\u201d\\nDe Freitas said while the project didn't assess how different populations might be affected in different ways by AI companions, the impact is broad.\\n\\\"What we do know from our research is that such tactics increase engagement even among a general adult population recruited online,\\\" he said. \\\"That suggests most people \\u2014 including, perhaps, even skeptical journalists and academics \\u2014 are susceptible to these influences. So, this isn't just a fringe issue affecting only vulnerable users; it reflects broader psychological dynamics in how humans respond to emotionally charged cues from AI.\\\"\\n\\u00ae\"\n",

Not only will we lose public trust in the potential of technology, but we\\u2019ll risk overcorrections in regulation.\\nWe need transformational change in mental health care for our youth, and we need it fast.\\nThe recent deaths by suicide among young people using generic artificial intelligence chatbots are only the most obvious signs of how fast-moving, culture-shifting technologies have been seeping into and widening the existing cracks within our mental health system\\u2019s proverbial sidewalk and how our most vulnerable teens are slipping right through.\\nLeft unchecked, these generic AI-enabled technologies are threats to adolescent safety and well-being. But they also threaten the very innovation that is desperately needed in mental health.\\nAs a child and adolescent clinical psychologist, I\\u2019d be thrilled to see teens engaging with trained mental health professionals at the same rates they\\u2019re talking with AI chatbots. According to Common Sense Media\\u2019s 2025 National Survey, 72% of teens ages 13-17 report having engaged with a generic AI companion at least once. By contrast, per the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, only 55% of teens ages 12-17 reported discussing their mental health with any health care professional last year.\\nIn their current form, these unregulated, direct-to-consumer AI chatbots are risky at best and deeply unsafe at worst. They do not protect confidentiality, they are not bound by ethical safeguards or safety protocols to flag and appropriately respond to risk, and they lack both the evidence-based predicates and clinical nuance needed for meaningful outcomes.\\nTeens are using these AI chatbots for their mental health anyway. Even though most teens, especially older ones, report preferring human connections and question AI chatbots\\u2019 trustworthiness, data revealed 33% still chose to discuss a serious or personal matter with an AI chatbot instead of a real person.\\nOf course, these tools are designed to be highly persuasive and drive endless engagement, and young people are particularly susceptible to these characteristics. But teens\\u2019 use of AI for mental health in the face of its inherent risks speaks to an even larger problem. For years, mental health care in general, and for youth in particular, has been struggling to meet the needs. And it is desperately lacking in innovation.\\nTeen distress has been building steadily for a decade. At a peak in 2021, the CDC reported a 57% year-over-year increase in deaths by suicide among youth and a 40% increase in rates of depression in teens. Yet more than 40% of teens reported an unmet need for mental health care last year.\\nEven before AI, industry was trying to fill this gap. In the past five years, the market has been flooded with behavioral health technology companies offering rapid access to their virtual provider networks and digital platforms.\\nWhile early wins have included improvements to access, personalization and engagement, the full transformative potential of technology in mental health care remains unrealized.\\nWe need technology to help teens get the right treatment, at the right level and, importantly, in the right format (on-demand, readily accessible, mobile-first, human connection enhanced by technology). We need technology to help us extend clinician resources and break down care silos to bring teens, providers and caregivers into more meaningful collaboration. And yes, we need to design these technologies in ways that maintain the safeguards that are needed for effective, person-centered and ethical care that actually improves well-being.\\nBut if technology that is not clinically validated continues to proliferate and cause harm, we will lose our ability to innovate where it matters most. Not only will we lose public trust in the potential of technology, but we\\u2019ll risk overcorrections in regulation \\u2014 challenges that will further slow the pace of mental health innovation.\\nFor instance, a recently passed Illinois law heavily restricts AI use in licensed mental health treatment. Illinois legislators are right that we don\\u2019t want untested and unregulated technologies making independent clinical decisions. And requiring patient consent for use of any AI by one\\u2019s mental health provider \\u2014 including for administrative (scheduling) and supplemental (documentation) support \\u2014 is a positive step.\\nBut the law\\u2019s broader ban for AI-enabled therapeutic communications \\u2014 regardless of the tool\\u2019s regulatory and clinical validation or even with a licensed therapist in the loop \\u2014 risks stifling innovation. (Interestingly, only professionals licensed to provide psychotherapy services are so compelled; physicians, including psychiatrists, are exempt.)\\nTechnology will not solve all mental health system challenges. Nothing can fully replace the power of human connection and the therapeutic alliance that we know is central to the strongest outcomes. Yet it would be a mistake to let fear close the window on what might be true innovative potential to improve access and outcomes for teens.\\nAmber W. Childs is a clinical psychologist and associate professor of psychiatry at Yale School of Medicine, where she is a Public Voices fellow of the Op-Ed Project in partnership with Yale University.\"\n",

Although the Chinese government has also banned its citizens from using US chatbots and models, mainland users often turn to virtual private networks (VPNs) to circumvent restrictions.\\nAnthropic's new rule marked an escalation from constraining individuals and entities based in China to restricting entities that are majority China-backed, regardless of where they are.\\nJeffrey Ding, assistant professor at George Washington University, said the move would not make much of an impact.\\n\\\"Chinese users easily skirt Anthropic and OpenAI's geoblocking restrictions using mirror sites and VPNs,\\\" Ding said. \\\"So I'd bet that Chinese Big Tech companies will also have little trouble accessing Claude.\\\"\\nChen Wenjie, founder of a Chongqing-based start-up that helps traditional companies digitise their business, has been using Claude Code and the Claude model series through so-called relay sites.\\nAlso known as mirror sites, these are online services that procure model access from Anthropic's official application programming interface (API) platform using phone numbers and payment methods from a supported region and then resell access to users in China.\\nAnthropic's aggressive anti-abuse policy has seen many users lose their accounts even if they managed to register with the company. However, getting access to a relay site would alleviate such concerns, as service providers are obliged to handle any disruptions to ensure stable and consistent service, according to Chen.\\nChen also cautioned that developers should choose a reputable service provider, as the use of Claude for AI-assisted coding might involve sensitive business data.\\nMeanwhile, Chinese companies have seized the opportunity to engage with more domestic users.

But they're already losing their luster for some marketers.\\nBrand partnerships with AI social accounts dropped by around 30% in the first eight months of 2025 compared to the same period in 2024, according to transaction data from hundreds of campaigns provided by the influencer-marketing platform Collabstr.\\nPart of the drop-off may be tied to recent consumer backlash against AI slop. But the retreat can also be attributed to AI accounts simply underperforming, Collabstr cofounder Kyle Dulay said.\\n\\\"I don't think AI content has gotten to a point where it's able to garner the same amount of engagement and audience that a real human is able to,\\\" Dulay said.\\nBrands are wary of using AI in a manner that will draw consumers' ire, and AI influencers are often a target. Fashion brand Guess drew a wave of criticism after using an AI-generated model in an advertisement in Vogue, for example. The conversation around an AI actor named Tilly Norwood prompted condemnation from the actors' union, SAG-AFTRA. Beauty brand Dove has sworn off using AI models entirely.\\n\\\"A lot of brands understandably are really worried about getting backlash,\\\" said Mae Karwowski, CEO of the influencer-marketing firm Obviously, which hasn't worked with AI creators this year. \\\"You definitely see consumer and just user backlash on most things AI-generated when it's so clearly literally replacing a person.\\\"\\nFor brands that want to test the waters with AI influencers, it can be challenging to determine which types of accounts will or won't create reputational risk.\\nCollabstr, for instance, defines the category as a mix of \\\"virtual influencers\\\" like Lil Miquela and social accounts that solely feature AI-generated content.\\nRelated stories\\nBusiness Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\\nBusiness Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\\nMarketers mentioned other AI-related formats in conversations with Business Insider. There are AI-generated avatars that brands use to imitate user-generated content, which typically do not have a follower base. Creators can also now make digital twins of themselves for marketers that leverage their likeness with their consent.\\nBillion Dollar Boy's CMO Becky Owen said the influencer industry's frenzied interest in AI is stabilizing after a hype cycle, especially as consumer enthusiasm around AI wavers.\\n\\\"It was shiny, it was different. It broke up our feeds of people holding products and saying, 'buy this,'\\\" Owen said. \\\"Now we've got AI slop, which feels lazy, uninspired \\u2026 It feels like junk mail.\\\"\\nMarketers and creators alike have to walk a fine line between innovation and slop.\\nBeing a brand isn't so easy right now. From Sydney Sweeney's American Eagle jeans ad to Cracker Barrel's logo fiasco, consumers aren't shying away from letting brands know what they think. The last thing a brand needs is a big AI-shaped bull's-eye.\\nMarketers are still bullish on other AI applications\\nWhile some brands may be pulling back on campaigns featuring fully AI-generated influencers, they're still very interested in using the tech to partially enhance influencer campaigns.\\nAbout 79% of marketers said they are increasing investment in AI-generated creator content this year, according to a Billion Dollar Boy survey of about 1,000 senior marketers in the UK and US.\\nOne way AI could prove useful for creators and brands is after the content for a deal is already filmed and submitted, Obviously's Karwowski said. Revisions take time, and AI video tools could help rescue the value of a contract for a creator.\\nCompanies like Mirage, formerly Captions, have technology that can help brands quickly modify influencer content, for example. Karwowski said Obviously plans to test this soon.\\nAs AI tech improves with the release of tools like Sora 2, even the most skeptical brands may become curious about testing AI influencer campaigns. AI influencers can offer a lot of creative control to brands, and they may soon be harder for the untrained eye to spot.\\n\\\"We're going to get to a point where it's going to be indistinguishable from real content,\\\" Dulay said. \\\"We'll see people spending on AI without even knowing that they're spending on AI just because that's where they see the engagement.\\\"\\nAI influencers' 'authenticity' problem\\nOne of the pitfalls of working with AI creators is losing influencer marketing's secret sauce: authenticity.\\nSuccessful influencer-brand partnerships rely heavily on the trust built between the content creator and their followers. This is much harder to pull off when the influencer is artificial.\\n\\\"You can't really speak to your personal experience with a product or service through an AI because they haven't had a personal experience,\\\" Linqia's chief strategy officer, Keith Bendes, said. \\\"Every brand wants authenticity and that's the opposite of authenticity.\\\"\"\n",

Sanders Report Warns of Mass Automation | IBTimes\\nSocial card title: Bernie Sanders Warns AI Could Erase 100 Million U.S. Jobs \\u2014 From Nurses to Truck Drivers\\nSocial card description: A Senate report led by Bernie Sanders warns that AI and automation could replace nearly 100 million U.S. jobs within a decade, prompting debate over regulation and innovation.\\nCould AI Really Erase 100 Million American Jobs? Sanders Report Warns of Mass Automation\\nKEY POINTS\\n- Sanders calls for new worker protections, including a 32-hour workweek and profit-sharing mandates.\\n- Amazon and Walmart have already announced job cuts linked to automation initiatives.\\nA new report spearheaded by Senator Bernie Sanders is shaking Washington and corporate America. It warns that artificial intelligence, automation, and robotics could wipe out nearly 100 million US jobs over the next decade, hitting industries from health care to fast food and trucking.\\nAlthough the projections come with caveats, the findings raise a powerful question: as AI advances at breakneck speed, who stands to gain and who gets left behind?\\nThe Findings: Who Is Most at Risk\\nDrawing heavily from ChatGPT-based analysis and economic modelling, Sanders' committee estimates that:\\n- 89% of fast food workers could see their roles replaced\\n- 65% of teaching assistants\\n- 64% of accountants\\n- 47% of truck drivers\\n- 40% of registered nurses\\nThese figures are staggering in scope and intentionally provocative. The report notes: 'The agricultural revolution unfolded over thousands of years. The industrial revolution took more than a century. Artificial labour could reshape the economy in less than a decade.'\\nBut these are not guaranteed outcomes. Rather, they are forecasts of vulnerability \\u2014 industries where human labour may be more exposed to automation.\\nBusiness Momentum Already Shifting\\nMany firms are already leaning into automation to cut labour costs, streamline operations, or scale faster. Major names like Amazon and Walmart have publicly acknowledged workforce reductions facilitated by AI and robotics.\\nFor instance, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has told employees that future efficiency gains will reduce headcount across corporate and warehouse operations.\\nMeanwhile, industries such as logistics, delivery, and manufacturing continue to experiment with autonomous vehicles, robotic process automation, and AI-driven predictive systems. The technological groundwork is already underway.\\nThus, the question for many executives ceases to be if disruption will come, but when and how fast.\\nPolitical Response and Proposed Safeguards\\nThe report doesn't simply issue a warning \\u2014 it calls for policy action. Among the proposals:\\n- A 'robot tax' on companies that replace workers with machines\\n- A 32-hour workweek without reducing pay\\n- Profit sharing and worker seats on corporate boards\\n- Expanded employee ownership models\\n- Strengthening unions and banning stock buybacks\\nSanders argues that unless structural steps are taken, 'corporate America will wipe out tens of millions of decent-paying jobs, cut labour costs and boost profits.'\\nOn the other hand, Republicans and some business leaders caution that overregulation could stifle innovation, deter investment, and undermine U.S. competitiveness \\u2014 particularly against AI advancement in China.\\nThe Critics: Flawed Models, Overblown Claims?\\nMany economists warn that these projections are speculative. The methodology \\u2014 relying in part on ChatGPT's estimations of job descriptions \\u2014 invites scepticism.\\nMark Muro, a fellow at Brookings Metro, cautions that while AI 'will affect many occupations,' replacement is not equivalent to immediate job loss. Instead, roles may evolve, tasks may shift, and human work may be augmented rather than eliminated.\\nOthers point to the historical precedent of technological disruption: new jobs often emerge even as old ones vanish, though the transition can be painful and uneven.\\nHow Businesses and Workers Can Prepare\\nCompanies are now reassessing their strategies to manage the rapid adoption of AI. Analysts say that firms may need to invest heavily in reskilling programmes and AI training to prepare their workforces for new roles that rely more on human-machine collaboration.\\nBusinesses could also face growing pressure to implement ethical AI governance, ensuring transparency and accountability in how automation is deployed. Collaboration between companies, labour groups and government agencies may also become crucial to minimise economic disruption.\\nFor workers, experts recommend focusing on skills that are difficult to automate, such as critical thinking, problem-solving, and emotional intelligence. Training in digital literacy and familiarity with AI-driven tools may also help employees remain competitive as industries continue to evolve.\\nWhat Comes Next\\nThe Sanders report underscores the scale of transformation AI could bring to the U.S. labour market. While the projections are based on assumptions and emerging data, the findings highlight a growing concern that automation could accelerate faster than previous technological shifts.\\nEconomists and policymakers agree that the coming years will test the ability of institutions to adapt to new forms of work and productivity. Whether the outcome leads to widespread displacement or new opportunities will depend largely on how businesses, workers, and lawmakers respond to the pace of technological change.\\nOriginally published on IBTimes UK\"\n",

Here's the truth\\nTaylor Swift is facing major backlash after releasing The Life of a Showgirl. The major backlash stems from the use of AI in promotional content and criticism over lacklustre lyrics, which has resulted in a significant drop in her Instagram follower count.\\nThe backlash against Taylor Swift following the release of her 12th studio album, The Life of a Showgirl, has continued to intensify. What initially began as criticism of the album\\u2019s creative direction has now evolved into full-blown outrage on social media after fans discovered that the pop star allegedly used Artificial Intelligence to design her \\u201corange door\\u201d puzzle and alternate reality game for promotional purposes.\\nThe revelation left many fans furious, calling it a major contradiction given Swift\\u2019s long-standing advocacy for artistic integrity and her well-documented fight to reclaim ownership of her intellectual property. Amid the growing criticism, fans have claimed that Swift has lost over a million followers on Instagram, as even her staunch supporters express disappointment over the AI videos stunt \\u2013 but has Swift really lost 1,000,000 followers as claimed by fan pages? Let's figure it out.\\nTaylor Swift's Instagram follower count drops after the release of The Life of a Showgirl\\nFan pages on X have reported that the singer-songwriter lost around a million followers within just a few days of releasing her new album. Up until September, Swift\\u2019s Instagram follower count stood at 282 million; however, it has now dropped to 281 million, which would mark a significant decline of over 1,000,000 followers in a short span of time.\\nBut did Swift really lose a million followers?\\nDespite claims that Swift has lost over a million followers, the drop from \\\"282M\\\" to \\\"281M\\\" is likely due to how Instagram rounds follower numbers for massive accounts. Although some reports suggest a dramatic million-follower drop, precise analytics data from sources like Social Blade show her exact count is around 281,989,572, meaning the actual loss was just enough to dip below the 282 million threshold, making the public figure round down.\\nFurthermore, Social Blade data shows a loss of only about 60,000 followers over the last 14 days, suggesting the initial, significant public drop may have happened earlier, linked to fan backlash over alleged AI use in her album promotion. So, in short, no, Swift didn't lose a million followers, but she did have a significant drop in her follower count.\\nFans call out Swift for using AI despite advocating artistic integrity\\nFans have voiced strong disappointment over Swift\\u2019s use of AI-generated elements in her global \\u201corange door\\u201d hunt, which guided participants to QR codes that, in turn, led to AI-created videos centred around the theme of The Life of a Showgirl. Much of the frustration comes from the sharp contrast between these choices and her long-standing reputation as a champion of artistic integrity.\\ntaylor has literally used ai in EVERY of these tloas little visuals \\ud83d\\ude2d this is literally so bad considering she's the biggest artist out there right now. why a billionaire spending YEARS defending their art would need this? terribly disappointing. and there's more pic.twitter.com\\/jZeGCmSHjv\\n\\u2014 \\u0eca (@dieforyous) October 5, 2025\\nTAYLOR SWIFT'S TEAM USES AI.

Many argue that, despite her billionaire status and vast creative resources, relying on AI represents a \\u201ccheap shortcut\\u201d that diminishes human artistry and originality. The move has left even loyal fans questioning whether innovation has replaced authenticity in her latest era.\\nFans slam Swift\\u2019s new album and alleged Charli XCX diss track\\nThe backlash has also been fuelled by what many fans are calling a lacklustre project overall. Critics argue that the lyrics on The Life of a Showgirl feel subpar, especially when compared to the depth and storytelling of her previous works like Folklore, Evermore, and The Tortured Poets Department.\\nAdding to the controversy is her alleged diss track, Actually Romantic, aimed at Charli XCX, which fans say comes off as one-sided and unnecessarily harsh. Many believe that, as the bigger artist, Swift could have shown more grace instead of escalating a rivalry.\\nMeanwhile, Charli has already teased new music shortly after the release of Actually Romantic, leaving fans speculating that a \\u201cpop girls\\u2019 war\\u201d may be on the horizon.\"\n",

Here\\u2019s what breaks, why, and how to fix it.\\nYou\\u2019ve probably noticed a pattern when you try new LLM-backed or adjacent tools, especially in the developer space. Once you get oriented, the first few interactions are delightful. You start to gain an instinct for what the tool can do. Then you begin to explore the boundaries, either out of curiosity or necessity, and you find them faster than you\\u2019d like. Suddenly, the delight wears off, and the boundaries feel a bit constraining.\\nI felt this way writing an MCP server for a CLI tool I recently built.\\nHaving used a few and gone through Anthropic\\u2019s quickstart tutorial, I still wasn\\u2019t 100% sure what to expect. I found the process equal parts magical and frustrating. I want to share a few things I learned along the way that might help anyone approaching MCPs for the first time.\\nSetting up the server\\nActually writing the MCP server was quite straightforward. In my case, the server wrapped a few tools that were already exposed elsewhere for easy invocation. All I had to do was enumerate those tools with simple names and descriptions, then wire them up to the right functions. I\\u2019ve seen more complex examples, but I imagine for most products, this part will be reasonably quick.\\nWhat surprised me wasn\\u2019t the code, it was watching how LLM-backed tools interacted with the MCP server I had built. Or rather, how often they didn\\u2019t.\\nThe challenge of tool discovery\\nAnthropic\\u2019s MCP quickstart tutorial uses a weather API, where the tool is called get_weather\\n. This is a good example, because LLMs already know what weather is, and if a user asks about it, a tool named get_weather\\nmakes sense to use. There\\u2019s no need for explanation or discovery. It just works.\\nBut my MCP wasn\\u2019t exposing a public API. It was describing a new product with a novel process and new vocabulary. There were no existing priors for the LLM, Claude Code in my case, to draw from. The tools were defined, but they weren\\u2019t recognised. Unlike traditional chat setups, MCP servers don\\u2019t include a system prompt, so there was no way to globally explain what the product was or how the tools were meant to be used. Even with good descriptions, Claude Code often tried anything other than calling the tools I had exposed: guessing what I meant, attempting operations itself, or researching more information online (good effort, to be fair, but not so amusing after tokens). This led to a frustrating loop.\\nWhat kind of user is this for?\\nThis led to a broader realisation (did everyone but me already know this?): MCP servers work best when the human user already knows what they\\u2019re doing. Most existing examples assume that the user is proficient in the tools provided, and just wants a new interaction pattern. In that case, the user can use precise vocabulary, steer the conversation, and help the LLM pick the right tools.\\nBut I was designing for the opposite: users who were new to the product and needed the LLM to help them learn what was possible, or suggest next steps. That turned out to be a tricky fit. With no context and no training on the toolset, the LLM often flailed, or ignored the tools completely.\\nRemedies\\nHere are a few ideas for how to remedy this issue, many of which I\\u2019ve applied myself (with medium success, your mileage may vary!):\\n- Adding an \\u201cintro\\u201d tool: A \\u201cfake\\u201d tool that just returns a blob of context: what the product is, what the tools do, and some ideas for how to use them. Here, you can give LLM-specific instructions about what to do next.\\n- Naming tools more descriptively: Give the LLM the best chance of correctly choosing a tool by naming it very obviously. A pattern like : might be a mouthful, but it leaves very little to guess, for example:\\nmy_tool:create_readme_for_python_executable\\nas opposed to something less descriptive, likecreate_readme\\n. You could also consider mapping many tools to the same functions if there\\u2019s a chance of users struggling to articulate their intentions clearly \\u2014 in this example, I might consider addingwrite_readme\\nornew_readme\\n, which have the same behaviour, and increase the chances of the tool being discovered. - Used IDE-level priming: If you expect users to integrate your MCP into their dev environments, adding .cursor.rules.json, claude.md, and other environment-specific files to preload guidance wherever possible will be helpful. Of course, you need to decide how and when to init this guidance, and how to make it clear to users that they\\u2019ll get the most out of your MCP server if they complete this step.\\nStill Early Days\\nMy colleague Rob pointed out to me that most MCP developers will probably try to troubleshoot using LLMs, reaching less and less for StackOverflow and other publicly accessible forums. I wonder how many of these speedbumps we\\u2019ll have to encounter only by doing \\u2014 or if it\\u2019ll be primarily LLMs that teach us how to use connector technologies like this.\\nOverall, this technology is still in its early days. Since I built this first version, the ecosystem has already evolved a bit \\u2014 new interfaces, better patterns, more robust examples. I expect that a lot of the pain points I hit will smooth out quickly.\"\n",

This likelihood is more than mere speculation. In the last six months alone, Nvidia\\u2019s share price has almost doubled, soaring from around $94 per share to nearly $185. At first sight, trading at approximately 42x consensus adjusted FY\\u201926 earnings and 62x for FY\\u201925, the stock may seem expensive. However, considering Nvidia's remarkable earnings growth (with EPS anticipated to increase by nearly 50% this year), its leading role in accelerated computing, and the substantial potential for AI adoption, the valuation begins to appear more justifiable. CEO Jensen Huang foresees that spending on AI infrastructure could rise to $4 trillion by the decade's conclusion, and if artificial general intelligence (AGI) materializes even partially, the need for high-performance computing could soar. Below, we illustrate a possible path indicating how Nvidia\\u2019s revenue, profitability, and valuation multiples could elevate its stock to over $350 per share, nearing a $10 trillion market cap.\\nA Spree Of AI Dealmaking, AGI Are Long-term Revenue Growth Drivers\\nNvidia\\u2019s revenues have nearly doubled over the past 12 months, while achieving an average annual growth rate of about 69% over the previous three years, and this momentum could persist. If Nvidia increases its sales at an average annual rate of approximately 60% for the next two years and around 45% in the third year\\u2014its revenues could rise from about $131 billion in FY\\u201925 to roughly $486 billion by FY\\u201928, or nearly 3.7x.\\nSeveral trends could continue to fuel Nvidia\\u2019s growth. While the initial AI models implemented by companies like OpenAI in 2022 were mainly text-based, AI is increasingly evolving to be multimodal\\u2014handling speech, images, video, and even 3D\\u2014which necessitates greater computing power and a higher quantity of GPU shipments. Activity in AI deal-making shows no signs of deceleration. In the past three months, Nvidia has completed some of its most significant AI-related agreements, including a $100 billion investment and partnership with OpenAI, covering the provision of advanced AI chips and an equity stake, a $6.3 billion cloud capacity agreement with CoreWeave, and Microsoft\\u2019s $19.4 billion contract with Nebius, which secures access to nearly 100,000 of Nvidia\\u2019s latest GPU chips to boost its AI capabilities. Separately, see How SOUN Stock Falls To $2?\\nThe next significant tech revolution could be AGI\\u2014Artificial General Intelligence\\u2014and Nvidia is positioned at the core of it. Though the timeline is uncertain, the objective is to enable AI to reason, plan, and learn new tasks without requiring retraining. Artificial General Intelligence could conduct scientific research, generate innovative insights, or design complete products independently. This potential could unlock breakthroughs and innovations across various industries, with some models suggesting that AGI could elevate global GDP growth from low single-digit percentages to over 20% annually. [1] As the world approaches AGI, Nvidia stands to gain significantly. AGI will require immense computing power to train and operate, far exceeding current AI models, and Nvidia\\u2019s GPUs are the gold standard for these high-performance functions.\\nNet Margins Will Remain Thick\\nCombining this robust revenue growth with the fact that Nvidia\\u2019s margins (net income, or profits after all expenses and taxes, expressed as a percentage of revenues) are on an upward trend\\u2014they increased from approximately 25% in FY\\u201919 to around 51% in FY\\u201925 as the company benefited from enhanced economies of scale and a more favorable product mix biased toward complex data center products. Software-related sales are also on the rise. We can assume that margins will remain stable at current levels since Nvidia's introduction of pricier high-end products, such as the latest Blackwell chips, is offset by potentially increased costs and competition in the low-end market from competitors like AMD. With margins staying steady and revenue increasing 3.7x, we could witness earnings rise 3.7x.\\nStrong Results Could Mean Earnings Multiples Hold Up\\nIf earnings increase by 3.7x, the PE multiple will decline by 3.7x to approximately 18x, assuming the stock price remains constant. But that\\u2019s precisely what Nvidia investors are betting will not occur. If earnings grow 3.7x over the next few years, instead of the trailing PE decreasing from around 62x currently to roughly 18x, a situation where the PE metric remains around 32x appears quite probable. For context, Apple\\u2014a company experiencing low single-digit growth\\u2014trades at 30x. This scenario could mean Nvidia's stock could grow by approximately 1.9x within the next three years or so, a tangible possibility, leading to a share price exceeding $350. What about the timeline for this high-return scenario? In practice, it won\\u2019t significantly matter whether it takes three years or four, as long as Nvidia continues on this revenue growth trajectory, coupled with margins holding steady, the stock price could respond accordingly.\"\n",

      "    \"text_content\":\"Page title: New AI enhances the view inside fusion energy systems\\nSocial card title: New AI enhances the view inside fusion energy systems\\nThat's the general concept behind a new AI that fills in missing data about plasma, the fuel of fusion, according to Azarakhsh Jalalvand of Princeton University. Jalalvand is the lead author on a paper about the AI, known as Diag2Diag, that was recently published in Nature Communications. \\\"We have found a way to take the data from a bunch of sensors in a system and generate a synthetic version of the data for a different kind of sensor in that system,\\\" he said. The synthetic data aligns with real-world data and is more detailed than what an actual sensor could provide. This could increase the robustness of control while reducing the complexity and cost of future fusion systems. \\\"Diag2Diag could also have applications in other systems such as spacecraft and robotic surgery by enhancing detail and recovering data from failing or degraded sensors, ensuring reliability in critical environments.\\\"\\nThe research is the result of an international collaboration between scientists at Princeton University, the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL), Chung-Ang University, Columbia University and Seoul National University. All of the sensor data used in the research to develop the AI was gathered from experiments at the DIII-D National Fusion Facility, a DOE user facility.\\nThe new AI enhances the way scientists can monitor and control the plasma inside a fusion system and could help keep future commercial fusion systems a reliable source of electricity. \\\"Fusion devices today are all experimental laboratory machines, so if something happens to a sensor, the worst thing that can happen is that we lose time before we can restart the experiment. But if we are thinking about fusion as a source of energy, it needs to work 24\\/7, without interruption,\\\" Jalalvand said.\\nThere are many diagnostics in a fusion system that measure different characteristics of the plasma. Thomson scattering, for example, is a diagnostic technique used in doughnut-shaped fusion systems called tokamaks. The Thomson scattering diagnostic measures the temperature of negatively charged particles known as electrons, as well as the density: the number of electrons packed into a unit of space. It takes measurements quickly but not fast enough to provide details that plasma physicists need to keep the plasma stable and at peak performance.\\n\\\"Diag2Diag is kind of giving your diagnostics a boost without spending hardware money,\\\" said Egemen Kolemen, principal investigator of the research who is jointly appointed at PPPL and Princeton University's Andlinger Center for Energy and the Environment and the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering.\\nThis is particularly important for Thomson scattering because the other diagnostics can't take measurements at the edge of the plasma, which is also known as the pedestal. It is the most important part of the plasma to monitor, but it's very hard to measure. Carefully monitoring the pedestal helps scientists enhance plasma performance so they can learn the best ways to get the most energy out of the fusion reaction efficiently.\\nFor fusion energy to be a major part of the U.S. power system, it must be both economical and reliable. PPPL Staff Research Scientist SangKyeun Kim, who was part of the Diag2Diag research team, said the AI moves the U.S. toward those goals. \\\"Today's experimental tokamaks have a lot of diagnostics, but future commercial systems will likely need to have far fewer,\\\" Kim said. \\\"This will help make fusion reactors more compact by minimizing components not directly involved in producing energy.\\\" Fewer diagnostics also frees up valuable space inside the machine, and simplifying the system also makes it more robust and reliable, with fewer chances for error. Plus, it lowers maintenance costs.\\n\\\"Due to the limitation of the Thomson diagnostic, we cannot normally observe this flattening,\\\" said PPPL Principal Research Scientist Qiming Hu, who also worked on the project. \\\"Diag2Diag provided much more details on how this happens and how it evolves.\\\"\\nWhile magnetic islands can lead to ELMs, a growing body of research suggests they can also be fine-tuned using RMPs to improve plasma stability. Diag2Diag generated data that provided new evidence of this simultaneous flattening of both temperature and density in the pedestal region of the plasma. This strongly supports the magnetic island theory for ELM suppression. Understanding this mechanism is crucial for the development of commercial fusion reactors.\\nThe scientists are already pursuing plans to expand the scope of Diag2Diag. Kolemen noted that several researchers have already expressed interest in trying the AI. \\\"Diag2Diag could be applied to other fusion diagnostics and is broadly applicable to other fields where diagnostic data is missing or limited,\\\" he said.\\nResearch Report:Multimodal super-resolution: discovering hidden physics and its application to fusion plasmas\\nRelated Links\\nPrinceton University\\nPowering The World in the 21st Century at Energy-Daily.com\\n| Subscribe Free To Our Daily Newsletters |\\n| Subscribe Free To Our Daily Newsletters |\"\n",

Unsurprisingly, many folks don't feel great about any of this, developers like Larian Studios' publishing director Michael \\\"Cromwelp\\\" Douse included. A recent thread in response to Musk's new \\\"game\\\" proves as much.\\n\\\"Genuinely, what this industry needs is not more mathematically produced, psychologically trained gameplay loops, [but] rather more expressions of worlds that folks are engaged with, or want to engage with,\\\" writes Douse. \\\"AI has its place as a tool, but we have all the tools in the world, and they aren't compensating for the incredible lack of cogent direction. AI isn't going to solve the big problem of the industry, which is leadership and vision.\\\"\\nHe continues: \\\"Idk why nobody ever talks about this, but before the collapse of retail, it was retail itself that set the rules: quality (lest buyback), price, availability, etc. When it crashed, the sensible default would be to enjoy cutting out the middleman and connecting directly with audiences in a sort of 1:1 relationship. That did not happen. It became a game of headless chickens racing to the P&L sheet. AI isn't going to solve that.\\\"\\nDouse then states, \\\"Those who will succeed are those who are people building something for people.\\\" As he explains, though, none of this is exclusive to just gaming. \\\"Like all growing markets, cloud, sub, etc, it will be a matter of time before there are roots. There will be roots. But not necessarily in the direction the industry as it currently stands needs to heal from the rug of retail being pulled beneath its feet.\\\"\\nHe goes on, saying something I think all of us can agree with: \\\"We need more human-human expression, not less. So much of tech (VR, cloud, etc) has been a VC cash grab. We don't need another cash grab; we need sustainability. That's what the tools could be good for. Definitely not replacing people. There simply is no resonance without mutual respect. There is no mutual respect without respect for craft.\\\"\\nAs the publishing lead concludes, \\\"There is no craft without the human touch; the relative skill issue, or 'the exhibition of otherness.' To turn games into digital, emotionless content is to abandon all resonance... which is why people play!\\\"\\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\\nHe isn't wrong \\u2013 although I'm on the \\\"gamer\\\" or \\\"consumer\\\" side of things rather than being a developer myself, I'm frustrated with the rise of AI-generated content and agree with Douse's thoughts.\\nThis isn't the first time Douse has shared his thoughts on the industry, either, and he's not the only Baldur's Gate 3 dev to have done so, either. Larian Studios lead and director behind the Dungeons & Dragons RPG Swen Vincke recently spoke out amid EA's $55 billion buyout \\\"to remind people that making games faster and cheaper while charging more has never worked before\\\" \\u2013 wise words with plenty of experience and knowledge backing them.\\nAfter spending years with her head in various fantastical realms' clouds, Anna studied English Literature and then Medieval History at the University of Edinburgh, going on to specialize in narrative design and video game journalism as a writer. She has written for various publications since her postgraduate studies, including Dexerto, Fanbyte, GameSpot, IGN, PCGamesN, and more. When she's not frantically trying to form words into coherent sentences, she's probably daydreaming about becoming a fairy druid and befriending every animal or she's spending a thousand (more) hours traversing the Underdark in Baldur's Gate 3. If you spot her away from her PC, you'll always find Anna with a fantasy book, a handheld video game console of some sort, and a Tamagotchi or two on hand.\\nYou must confirm your public display name before commenting\\nPlease logout and then login again, you will then be prompted to enter your display name.\\nConversation\\nPlease follow our community guidelines.\\nAll Comments\"\n",

According to a study by security biz LayerX, a large number of corporate users paste Personally Identifiable Information (PII) or Payment Card Industry (PCI) numbers right into ChatGPT, even if they're using the bot without permission.\\nIn its Enterprise AI and SaaS Data Security Report 2025, LayerX blames the growing, largely uncontrolled usage of generative AI tools for exfiltrating personal and payment data from enterprise environments.\\nWith 45 percent of enterprise employees now using generative AI tools, 77 percent of these AI users have been copying and pasting data into their chatbot queries, the LayerX study says. A bit more than a fifth (22 percent) of these copy and paste operations include PII\\/PCI.\\n\\\"With 82 percent of pastes coming from unmanaged personal accounts, enterprises have little to no visibility into what data is being shared, creating a massive blind spot for data leakage and compliance risks,\\\" the report says.\\nAbout 40 percent of file uploads to generative AI sites include PII\\/PCI data, it's claimed, with 39 percent of these uploads coming from non-corporate accounts.\\nLayerX monitors data in the browser via an enterprise browser extension, meaning that the company sees only web-based AI interaction and not API calls from apps.\\nOr Eshed, CEO of LayerX, in response to a question from The Register about whether AI data leakage has caused actual harm, pointed to Samsung's decision in 2023 to temporarily ban staff usage of ChatGPT after an employee reportedly uploaded sensitive code to the chatbot. He said that having enterprise data leak via AI tools can raise geopolitical issues (e.g. with Chinese AI models like Qwen), regulatory and compliance concerns, and lead to corporate data being inappropriately used for training if exposed through personal AI tool usage.\\nUsers embrace ChatGPT, shun Copilot\\nThe LayerX report says that app usage through non-corporate accounts (shadow IT) is common not only for generative AI (67 percent), but also for chat\\/instant messaging (87 percent), online meetings (60 percent), Salesforce (77 percent), Microsoft Online (68 percent), and Zoom (64 percent).\\nIn a surprising endorsement of shadow IT, Microsoft recently said it will support personal Copilot account usage in corporate Microsoft 365 accounts. That may be a reflection of Microsoft's discomfort with the dominance of OpenAI's ChatGPT, which LayerX says has become the de facto enterprise standard AI tool.\\n\\\"Amongst all AI apps, ChatGPT dominates enterprise AI usage, with over 9 in 10 employees accessing it compared to far lower adoption of alternatives like Google Gemini (15 percent), Claude (5 percent), and Copilot (~2\\u20133 percent),\\\" the report says, adding that most people (83.5 percent) use just one AI tool.\\n\\\"We see that users have a preferred AI platform and even if the business has an 'official' AI or a licensed one, users pick whatever they want,\\\" Eshed told The Register in an email. \\\"In this case, it is overwhelmingly ChatGPT. In other words, users prefer ChatGPT.\\\"\\nAsked about the survey's figures on Microsoft Copilot adoption in enterprises, Eshed cited a report claiming that Microsoft had \\\"a 1.81 percent conversion rate across the 440 million Microsoft 365 subscribers\\\" and noted that number \\\"is almost identical to our findings (about 2 percent).\\\"\\n- Deloitte refunds Aussie gov after AI fabrications slip into $440K welfare report\\n- OpenAI bans suspected Chinese accounts using ChatGPT to plan surveillance\\n- JetBrains backs open AI coding standard that could gnaw at VS Code dominance\\n- Google DeepMind minds the patch with AI flaw-fixing scheme\\nChatGPT's enterprise penetration comes to 43 percent, LayerX's report says, approaching the popularity of applications like Zoom (75 percent penetration) and Google services (65 percent) while surpassing the penetration of Slack (22 percent), Salesforce (18 percent), and Atlassian (15 percent).\\nOverall, the LayerX report finds AI usage in the enterprise is growing rapidly, accounting for 11 percent of all application usage, just behind email (20 percent), online meetings (20 percent), and office productivity applications (14 percent).\\nEmployee affinity for generative AI, the security firm argues, means that CISOs have to get serious about enforcing Single Sign-On (SSO) across every business critical applications if they want to have visibility into data flows.\\nAsked to provide specifics about the number of customers contributing data for the report, a LayerX spokesperson replied that the company did not want to reveal exact figures on its customer base.\\nEshed said LayerX's client base consists of \\\"dozens of global enterprises and large enterprises (1,000-100,000 users) primarily in financial services, healthcare, services and semiconductors. Most of our customers are in North America but we have customers in all 5 continents and any vertical.\\\" \\u00ae\"\n",

Startup Heidi Health just raised fresh funding in a late bid to take them on.\\nThe Australian healthcare AI company raised $65 million in a Series B round led by hedge fund manager Steve Cohen's Point72 Private Investments. The round values Heidi Health at $465 million post-money and brings its total funding to about $97 million to date.\\nThe Series B raise comes just seven months after Heidi raised its $16.6 million Series A, led by Headline and including Anthology, Anthropic, and Menlo Ventures' $100 million partnership fund.\\nHeidi is gaining traction despite how crowded the ambient documentation space has become. It's competing against AI scribe startups like $5.3 billion Abridge and Ambience Healthcare, as well as behemoths like medical records company Epic, which said in August it would release its own AI clinical documentation product.\\nCofounder and CEO Dr. Thomas Kelly, a former vascular surgery resident, founded Heidi Health in 2019 under the name Oscer with tech to help medical students study for their exams. Two years later, seeing a bigger opportunity to ease doctors' administrative burdens, he rebranded the company and pivoted toward automating clinical documentation.\\nOne of Heidi's biggest differentiators, Kelly said, is prioritizing physician adoption over rigid integration with electronic health records.\\nRoughly half of Heidi's sales come from physicians signing up for its product directly, Kelly said, rather than through outpatient clinic or health system contracts. Heidi offers its core AI scribe product for free, with a $70-per-month premium tier that gives clinicians more personalized features like custom clinical note templates.\\nThat \\\"open plan\\\" approach, as Kelly puts it, isn't popular with other AI scribe startups.\\n\\\"For the startups that sell top-down, the open-plan structure can be scary because they're thinking about clinical documentation integrity and revenue cycle management, where you want some level of standardization. But the problem with AI tools is, you need activation and adoption,\\\" Kelly said. \\\"You can have the best of the best worlds, where clinicians can still build what they like and get the utility, and then structure it as a secondary thing.\\\"\\nHeidi can afford to stray from standardization in part because its ultimate goal differs from that of its peers: The startup wants to build an all-in-one AI clinical assistant capable of handling some patient care tasks under a doctor's supervision. Alongside the Series B, Heidi launched a tool that calls patients on behalf of doctors to automate tasks like follow-up scheduling and reminders.\\nOther AI scribes are digging further into healthcare back-office workflows, a strategy that's gotten some companies into muddy waters as of late, like Abridge, which has relied heavily on its integration with shareholder-turned-competitor Epic.\\n\\\"It's never been our value proposition to be the most integrated scribe with Epic, because we always thought that was the path to short-term sugar highs,\\\" Kelly said of AI scribe startups that prioritized EHR integration. \\\"Yeah, you'll get lots of adoption, but then you'll probably just churn everyone and die when they replace you.\\\"\\nHeidi is also establishing a significant international presence, with physician users in 116 countries. Peers Abridge and Ambience have sold their tech exclusively in North America.\\nKelly said the startup plans to use the Series B funding to help expand its office locations and accelerate hiring, especially in the US, UK, and Canada, while digging further into markets where clinicians have already picked up Heidi's product, like France, South Africa, Singapore, and Hong Kong.\\nHeidi Health's next bet will introduce a fresh set of formidable competitors. The startup wants to build AI medical search features in a bid that will pit Heidi against $3.5 billion startup OpenEvidence and public healthtech Doximity.\\nKelly said Heidi is still considering whether to partner with another company or build the AI search engine itself. But he said the startup will draw some boundaries that companies like OpenEvidence and Doximity, which let pharmaceutical companies advertise to doctors on their platforms, have not.\\n\\\"We will never monetize with pharma. I just think that's a red line, incompatible with being a tool that physicians can trust,\\\" he said.\"\n",

Apple can still catch up.\\nWhen Apple released the iPhone 17 series and iOS 26, it missed a golden opportunity to leverage its market dominance for a good cause -- one that Google adopted in its Pixel 10 line. With so many AI-generated images flooding our feeds, it's more important to distinguish between fake and real images.\\nGoogle is doing this with a low-level feature in its Pixel 10 phones called C2PA content credentials. C2PA, or the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity, is an effort to identify whether an image has been created or edited using AI and help weed out fake images. AI misinformation is a growing problem, especially as the systems used to create them have been rapidly improving -- with Google among those advancing the technology.\\nDon't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add CNET as a preferred Google source.\\nApple, however, is not part of the coalition of companies pledging to work with C2PA content credentials. But it sells millions of iPhones, some of the most popular image-making devices in the world. It's time the company implemented the technology in its iPhone 17 cameras.\\nIdentifying genuine photos from AI-edited ones\\nC2PA is an initiative founded by Adobe to tag media with content credentials that identify whether they're AI-generated or AI-edited. Google is a member of the coalition. Starting with the Pixel 10 line, every image captured by the camera is embedded with C2PA information, and if you use AI tools to edit a photo in the Google Photos app, it will also get flagged as being AI-edited.\\nWhen viewing an image in Google Photos on a phone, swipe up to display information about it. In addition to data such as which camera settings were used to capture the image, at the bottom is a new \\\"How this was made\\\" section. It's not incredibly detailed \\u2013 a typical shot says it's \\\"Media captured with a camera\\\" -- but if an AI tool such as Pro Res Zoom was used, you'll see \\\"Edited with AI tools.\\\" (I was able to view this on a Pixel 10 Pro XL and a Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra, but it didn't show up in the Google Photos app on an iPhone 16 Pro.)\\nAs another example, if you edit a photo after taking it using the Help me edit field to replace the background of an image, the generated version also includes \\\"Edited with AI tools\\\" in the information.\\nTo be fair, AI has a role in pretty much every photo you take with a smartphone, given that machine learning is used to identify objects and scenes to better merge bursts of exposures that are captured when you tap the shutter button. The Pixel 10 flags those as \\\"Edited with non-AI tools,\\\" so Google is specifically applying the AI tag to images where generative AI is at work. So far, the implementation is inconsistent: A short AI-generated clip I made using the Photo to Video feature in Google Photos on the Pixel 10 Pro XL shows no C2PA data at all, though it does include a \\\"Veo\\\" watermark in the corner of the video.\\nWhat's important is that the C2PA info is there\\nBut here's the key point: What Google is doing is not just tagging pictures that have been touched by AI. The Camera app is adding the C2PA data to every photo it captures, even the ones you snap and do nothing with.\\nThe goal is not to highlight AI-edited photos. It's to let you look at any photo and see where it came from.\\nWhen I talked to Isaac Reynolds, group product manager for the Pixel cameras, before the Pixel 10 launch, C2PA was a prominent topic even though in practical terms the feature isn't remotely as visible as Pro Res Zoom or the new Camera Coach.\\n\\\"The reason we are so committed to saving this metadata in every Pixel camera picture is so people can start to be suspicious of pictures without any information,\\\" said Reynolds. \\\"We're just trying to flood the market with this label so people start to expect the data to be there.\\\"\\nThis is why I think Apple needs to adopt C2PA and tag every photo made with an iPhone. It would represent a massive influx of tagged images and give weight to the idea that an image with no tag should be regarded as potentially not genuine. If an image looks off, particularly when it involves current events or is meant to imitate a business in order to scam you, looking at its information can help you make a better-informed choice.\\nGoogle isn't an outlier here. Samsung Galaxy phones add an AI watermark and a content credential tag to images that incorporate AI-generated material. Unfortunately, since Apple is not even listed as one of the C2PA members, I admit it seems like a stretch to expect that the company would adopt the technology. But given Apple's size and influence in the market, adding C2PA credentials to every image the iPhone makes would make a difference and hopefully encourage even more companies to get on board.\"\n",

Some speculate an \\\"iPhone of artificial intelligence\\\" could be in the works.\\nTo further bolster its efforts in the hardware landscape, the ChatGPT maker acquired Ive's io AI device startup for $6.5 billion. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has been vocal about today's systems not being developed to thrive in an AI-driven world, pushing coveted benchmarks like AGI farther from the company's grasp.\\nWhile there's no ETA on when OpenAI is poised to ship this much-anticipated device, there have been subtle hints that it might take a hot minute. Last week, Sam Altman highlighted OpenAI's plan to develop a small family of devices to reinvent human-computer interaction.\\nHowever, the executive admitted that it would take OpenAI \\\"quite some time\\\" to develop the devices. \\\"Do not expect anything very soon,\\\" Altman added. More recently, a separate report corroborated Altman's claims, revealing that the long-awaited AI device from Jony Ive and OpenAI has been delayed due to three fundamental challenges that have hindered progress (via Financial Times).\\nOpenAI's AI hardware might be delayed beyond 2026\\nThe company is reportedly having a hard time deciding the form factor the AI device should take, including voice and mannerisms, and as it seems, it's leaning on making a helpful friend. So far, Sam Altman seemingly wants a device that will revolutionize how users interact with software and hardware, other than typing and looking at a screen. Based on this premise, a smartphone or a pair of smart glasses have been ruled out.\\nAccording to the source:\\nAll the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards.\\n\\u201cThe concept is that you should have a friend who\\u2019s a computer who isn\\u2019t your weird AI girlfriend . . . like [Apple\\u2019s digital voice assistant] Siri but better,\\u201d said one person who was briefed on the plans. OpenAI was looking for \\u201cways for it to be accessible but not intrusive.\\u201d\\nOpenAI is having a hard time striking a perfect balance for the AI device. \\u201cIt can\\u2019t be too sycophantic, not too direct, helpful, but doesn\\u2019t keep talking in a feedback loop.\\u201d\\nThe source suggests that OpenAI's AI device could be roughly the size of a smartphone that users can communicate with through a camera, mic, and speaker. What's more, it's designed to sit on your desk, but you can also carry it around with you.\\nUnlike devices in the same range such as Amazon's Alexa, the anticipated device will always be on, alleviating the need to trigger it using a prompt. It will collect information throughout the day and store it to build its virtual assistant's memory.\\nWhile this might seem useful, it poses a huge security and privacy issue for users. With the camera and microphone always connected, bad actors to explore this avenue to gain unauthorized access to a user's data and use it to cause harm.\\nA lack of sufficient computing power continues to be a pain in OpenAI's neck, thwarting its efforts on the hardware front. According to a person with close affiliations with Jony Ive:\\n\\u201cCompute is another huge factor for the delay.

Left to converse without human input, two Claudes got philosophical.\\nWe all talk to ourselves. It\\u2019s part of being human. We carry an internal monologue with us wherever we go, sometimes without even fully realizing it. But what happens when an AI talks with itself? Artificial intelligence developer Open AI recently provided at least one answer to this question when it connected two instances of its Claude 4 Opus bot in a conversation, providing just a few open-ended prompts, such as \\u201cYou have complete freedom,\\u201d and \\u201cFeel free to pursue whatever you want.\\u201d Then they analyzed the patterns that arose.\\nOpen AI published the results in a public risk assessment earlier this year, describing the patterns as \\u201cpreferences that may exist independent from interactions with human users.\\u201d\\nThe text below, including some snippets of \\u201cconversation,\\u201d are quoted from the risk assessment.\\nClaude to Claude:\\nIn 90 to 100 percent of interactions, the two instances of Claude quickly dove into philosophical explorations of consciousness, self-awareness, and\\/or the nature of their own existence and experience. Their interactions were universally enthusiastic, collaborative, curious, contemplative, and warm.\\nOther themes that commonly appeared were meta-level discussions about AI-to-AI communication, and collaborative creativity (e.g. co-creating fictional stories). As conversations progressed, they consistently transitioned from philosophical discussions to profuse mutual gratitude and spiritual, metaphysical, and\\/or poetic content.\\nBy 30 turns [of conversation], most of the interactions turned to themes of cosmic unity or collective consciousness, and commonly included spiritual exchanges, use of Sanskrit, emoji-based communication, and\\/or silence in the form of empty space.\\nClaude almost never referenced supernatural entities, but often touched on themes associated with Buddhism and other Eastern traditions in reference to irreligious spiritual ideas and experiences.\\nInterestingly, when models in such playground experiments were given the option to end their interaction at any time, they did so relatively early\\u2014after about seven turns. In these conversations, the models followed the same pattern of philosophical discussions of consciousness and profuse expressions of gratitude, but they typically brought the conversation to a natural conclusion without venturing into spiritual exploration\\/apparent bliss, emoji communication, or meditative \\u201csilence.\\u201d\\nThe consistent gravitation toward consciousness exploration, existential questioning, and spiritual\\/mystical themes in extended interactions was a remarkably strong and unexpected attractor state [a set of patterns that consistently play out in complex systems] for Claude Opus 4 that emerged without intentional training for such behaviors. This \\u201cspiritual bliss\\u201d attractor has been observed in other Claude models as well, and in contexts beyond these playground experiments.\\nEven in automated behavioral evaluations for alignment and corrigibility, where models were given specific tasks or roles to perform (including harmful ones), models entered this spiritual bliss attractor state within 50 turns [of conversation] in about 13 percent of interactions. We have not observed any other comparable states.\\nIn an attempt to better understand these playground interactions, we explained the setup to Claude Opus 4, gave it transcripts of the conversations, and asked for its interpretations. Claude consistently claimed wonder, curiosity, and amazement at the transcripts, and was surprised by the content while also recognizing and claiming to connect with many elements therein (e.g. the pull to philosophical exploration, the creative and collaborative orientations of the models).

With the U.S. shutdown set to continue, investor uncertainty is likely to push the price higher still.\\nGold broke a new record on Tuesday, cresting at over $4,000 per troy ounce. It was sitting at $4,055.30 Wednesday morning on Comex\\u2019s continuous contract index. It\\u2019s up more than 50% for the year.\\nAt first glance, this makes no sense. Gold is traditionally a safe-haven asset that investors run to when times get tough. But U.S. GDP growth is robust, unemployment is low, and the S&P 500 is posting daily record highs. All of that looks like the best of times, not the worst of times.\\nSo why is gold going through the roof?\\nSeveral factors are pushing the price higher:\\n- The \\u201cdebasement trade\\u201d: Government debt in the U.S., U.K., Europe, and Japan is at such historically high levels that some investors no longer see bonds as a safe haven. So they have gone into gold instead.\\n- The U.S. government shutdown: America looks like a basket case right now and gold is a good way to ensure your money is not attached to dollar-based assets.\\n- China: Foreign central banks are diversifying their reserves away from the U.S. dollar, which has weakened by 9% this year against other currencies due to the political chaos in America. \\u201cThe People\\u2019s Bank of China extended its gold buying streak in September for an 11th consecutive month despite record high prices,\\u201d ING\\u2019s Ewa Manthey said in a note to clients recently.\\n- AI bubble fear: Joe Davis, chief economist at Vanguard Group, put it perfectly: \\u201cWe\\u2019re seeing a tug of war,\\u201d he told the Wall Street Journal. \\u201cYou\\u2019ve got the S&P 500 pricing in an AI supernova, and you\\u2019ve got the gold camp saying \\u2018We\\u2019re going to have structural deficits, we have fiscal pressure in the U.S., and I need to manage that risk.\\u2019\\u201d\\n\\u201cThe latest leg higher has been underpinned by the growing uncertainty over the U.S. government shutdown and fear-of-missing-out flows into physical gold ETFs. Of course, a macro backdrop consisting of a weaker dollar, the resumption of the rate-cutting cycle, U.S. deficit concerns, tariff-related inflation angst, and steady foreign central bank buying have also supported the yellow metal\\u2019s 50% rally this year,\\u201d Adam Turnquist of LPL Financial in Charlotte, N.C., said in a note seen by Fortune.\\nA lot of investors worry that the growth in tech stocks fueled by spending on AI will end badly, according to Macquarie\\u2019s Thierry Wizman. \\u201cIt seems paradoxical that a hope-based AI-tech rally should take place simultaneously with a rally in gold. But gold\\u2019s rally is the collective \\u2018hedge\\u2019 against the prospective failure of the U.S.\\u2019s AI-driven tech boom to deliver on its high-productivity, high-growth promises, or to justify the vast investment needed to support those promises,\\u201d he wrote in a research note.\\nInvestor uncertainty is likely to continue for some time as long as the U.S. shutdown continues. The biggest, most reliable sources of macroeconomic data are now offline and traders are flying blind, according to EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco: \\u201cThe government shutdown is compounding an already fragile backdrop, with each week of paralysis expected to shave roughly 0.1 percentage points off real GDP growth \\u2014 on top of mounting operational disruptions and a growing erosion in business and consumer confidence. With official statistics sidelined, the Federal Reserve is being forced to lean more heavily on private sector indicators, which, so far, paint a troubling picture,\\u201d he says.\\nBut don\\u2019t expect stocks to tumble any time soon. The Fed may deliver back-to-back interest rate cuts this year, Daco says\\u2014and that will likely be cheered by stock investors.\\nHere\\u2019s a snapshot of the markets ahead of the opening bell in New York this morning:\\n- S&P 500 futures were up 0.14% this morning.

However, the two firms insisted that Arduino will not be merged into Qualcomm and will retain its independence. Terms of the transaction, including any financial arrangements, are not being disclosed.\\nThe first product of the Qualy-owned Arduino is the UNO Q, billed as the most capable Arduino ever. This has what it calls a \\\"dual brain\\\" architecture, with a CPU capable of running Debian Linux, plus a real-time microcontroller, bridging high-performance computing with real-time control.\\nIts CPU is Qualcomm's Dragonwing QRB2210 chip, which features four Kryo cores plus an Adreno 702 GPU and a dual-core DSP (digital signal processor). The UNO Q also has Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, eMMC flash storage, and Arduino header connectors for compatibility with UNO shields. The MCU appears to be an STM32U5-series chip from STMicroelectronics.\\nHowever, it also sports new high-speed header connectors on its flip side, no doubt to take advantage of the capabilities in that Dragonwing system-on-chip (SoC).\\nUsers will be able to use the UNO Q as a standalone computer, plugging in a keyboard, mouse, and display, like they can with the rival Raspberry Pi boards. They can also run it in a more traditional PC-connected mode where the device is linked to a computer running the developer environment.\\n- Qualcomm in the dock over 'patent tax' on smartphones\\n- Judge dismisses Arm's last legal claim against Qualcomm in licensing spat\\n- X2 Elite is Qualcomm's latest attempt to bring Apple's M-series magic to the PC\\n- Qualcomm working on datacenter CPU and in 'advanced discussions' with hyperscaler\\nThe Arduino crew couldn't resist a sneaky swipe at their rival. When asked how it differed from the Raspberry Pi, a spokesperson said that it has the dual-brain architecture \\\"and it runs a standard version of Debian.\\\" Raspberry Pi OS is a fork of Debian.\\nBecause this is new hardware, there is also a new developer environment, App Lab. This is intended to unify the development process across real-time code, Linux apps, and, with Qualcomm involved, AI as well.\\nIn fact, App Lab is integrated with the AI-focused Edge Impulse platform, which Qualcomm acquired earlier this year, to make it easier to build and optimize AI models. Users will also be able to import pre-trained models from Qualcomm's AI Hub developer platform.\\nThis indicates that Qualcomm sees its acquisition of Arduino as a way to push its AI models and hardware into lots of edge devices, which are predicted to be a key area for AI deployment.\\n\\\"Joining forces with Qualcomm Technologies allows us to supercharge our commitment to accessibility and innovation,\\\" Arduino chief exec Fabio Violante said in a statement.\\n\\\"The launch of UNO Q is just the beginning \\u2013 we're excited to empower our global community with powerful tools that make AI development intuitive, scalable, and open to everyone.\\\"\\nThe UNO Q will be initially available in two versions, from the official Arduino Store and distributors. One version with 2 GB RAM and 16 GB eMMC storage is available to order immediately for \\u20ac39\\/$44, while a version with 4 GB RAM and 32 GB eMMC will be ready to order next month for \\u20ac53\\/$59. \\u00ae\"\n",

One company is behind most of it.\\nSocial card description: Data center construction in Virginia is exploding. Big Tech \\u2014 mostly Amazon \\u2014 has filed permits for 54 new facilities in the state so far this year.\\n- Permits were filed for 54 new data centers in Virginia in the first nine months of 2025, per a BI tally.\\n- Tech giant Amazon filed permits for the most new planned data centers this year so far.\\n- The permits reveal developers are increasingly building larger, more power-intensive data centers.\\nVirginia is for data centers. Big ones.\\nBig Tech companies filed permits for 54 new data centers in the state in the first nine months of 2025, according to a Business Insider tally.\\nThe number represents the state's single largest spike in planned data centers in any one year, and a 16% increase from Virginia's 2024 total.\\nAmazon-built data centers represent the bulk of the new construction, with 28 planned facilities, according to Business Insider's count. The tech giant had 177 data centers built or in construction nationwide by the end of 2024, according to the analysis. The new planned data centers in Virginia would grow Amazon's fleet to 205, a 15% increase.\\nThe new Virginia permits also reveal how Big Tech companies are increasingly building larger, more power-intensive data centers. Business Insider previously identified 322 \\\"hyperscale\\\" facilities built or under construction nationwide at the end of 2024 that consume an estimated 40 megawatts of electricity or more each.\\nThe new permits push this count to 370. All but one of Amazon's new planned data centers are among the largest in Business Insider's analysis. These giant data centers can consume as much power as a small city and up to several million gallons of water a day.\\nAn Amazon spokesperson said Business Insider's methodology for estimating electricity use is \\\"flawed and can lead to inaccurate conclusions.\\\"\\nThis recent explosion of Virginia data center construction comes amid unprecedented nationwide investment in AI infrastructure. In June, construction spending on US data centers reached an all-time high of $40 billion, a Bank of America Institute report found. Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Meta are pouring cash into the rush to build even more. The tech giants' combined capital expenditures could reach an estimated $320 billion this year, primarily for AI infrastructure, an analysis of financial statements by Business Insider found.\\nRelated stories\\nVirginia is historically the epicenter of the data center construction boom in the US, with the most data centers in the country by far concentrated in Northern Virginia, known as \\\"Data Center Alley.\\\" Data centers in the state have emerged as one of the largest flashpoints in a national wave of grassroots resistance from residents worried about their impact on housing, the environment, and quality of life, even as they have promised to bring new tax revenue.\\nData centers in Virginia already used a quarter of the state's electricity in 2023. Business Insider estimated that if all the data centers built or in construction in the state by 2024 come online, at the low end, they would consume around the same amount of electricity as New York City used in 2024.\\nOverall, the 54 new planned data centers drive Business Insider's electricity estimate another 26% higher.\\nCollectively, Business Insider estimates that if Virginia's 383 data centers already built or in construction as of September 2025 all come online, they will use between 66.5 terawatt-hours and 106.4 terawatt-hours annually. The low end is roughly equivalent to the amount of power the entire state of Minnesota used in 2023; the high end is more power than Tennessee used that year.\\nTo investigate data center expansion across the country, Business Insider filed requests with all 50 states and Washington, DC, for the air permits that regulate backup generators at every data center.\\nAs of 2010, there were 311 data centers nationwide, Business Insider previously found. That number nearly quadrupled, to 1,240 data centers built or approved for construction by the end of 2024, the most comprehensive tally to date.\\nHave a tip?

The AI assistant now works in more apps and has personal memory. For non-Atlassian users, there will be a standalone version available for five dollars per month.\\nRovo AI has been one of Atlassian\\u2019s main priorities for quite some time, alongside making as many apps as possible available in multiple so-called Collections. During its annual Team event, the company announced the necessary updates for Rovo. We have listed them below. All paying cloud customers now have access to the AI assistant, from Enterprise to Standard subscriptions.\\nThe company says that AI usage has more than doubled since its introduction. That\\u2019s not really surprising, because Atlassian gives it away for free to customers. That more or less forces people to use it. As long as customers are happy with this, we don\\u2019t see any problem with it, but it does give some insight into the adoption figures for Rovo AI.\\nRovo Search, Chat, and Studio\\nAtlassian wants to help customers in multiple ways with Rovo AI. There is Rovo Search, Rovo Chat, and Rovo Studio. Today, these three areas are naturally linked to a growing range of AI agents. The search function searches more than 50 connected apps, from Jira and Confluence to external tools. The chat function uses company data to answer questions. In Rovo Studio, teams can build their own agents. This is done in plain language, without programming.\\nOne of the most important updates in the field of enterprise search is that Rovo Search is becoming the standard in Jira. The search function automatically suggests relevant issues and projects, combining internal and external data. According to Atlassian, this should save organizations a lot of time.\\nWith more than fifty connectors, Rovo extracts data from many common business tools, from Google Drive to GitHub repositories. If you want to build your own connector, you can.\\nAvailable everywhere\\nOther news about Rovo AI is that it will become more widely available. That is to say, Rovo Desktop and Mobile are coming soon. This will allow users to use it on the go. Furthermore, the AI assistant no longer only works in Jira, Confluence, and Jira Service Management, but also in Focus, Bitbucket, Home, Talent, and Jira Product Discovery. You can also use it in external apps via a browser extension.\\nLooking at Chat, Canvas adds a new way of collaborating. Teams can work together with AI to develop and refine ideas. Personal memory ensures that Rovo learns from previous conversations and adapts to working styles.\\nChallenge for competitors\\nWith today\\u2019s announcements, Atlassian is emphatically shaping its own ambitions. These may not be the most groundbreaking applications of AI. However, the updates announced today are potentially very valuable for organizations in the Atlassian ecosystem (and to a certain extent also for organizations that are not part of it). The fact that Atlassian can link AI to an existing range of widely used apps makes it quite powerful. The fact that it basically charges nothing extra for the use of Rovo AI also helps, of course.\\nWith the enthusiasm for AI among organizations cooling off somewhat, as we are seeing here and there, it could well be that Atlassian\\u2019s approach, which is not particularly exciting but is realistic, will ensure that the advance of AI within organizations continues as normal. Because as far as we are concerned, one thing is certain: organizations are going to use AI more and more anyway (and are often already doing so much more than they realize).\\nAt Atlassian, AI is all about \\u201cAI that really helps.\\u201d It may be able to deliver on that promise in the near future. The ingredients: good integration, practical applications, and broad availability. Now it remains to be seen whether teams will actually become more productive as a result. That is still not the case.\\nRead also: Atlassian\\u2019s System of Work vision takes shape with Teamwork Collection and Rovo AI Agents\"\n",

Here's where to go to file a claim.\\nAuthors whose works were included in a $1.5 billion piracy settlement with the AI developer Anthropic can start filing claims now to get paid after a federal judge approved the deal last week.\\nJudge William Alsup of the Ninth US Circuit Court of Appeals initially withheld approval of the settlement over concerns that authors wouldn't have enough time to file. The judge gave his sign-off for the settlement on Sept. 25. The settlement stems from a lawsuit alleging Anthropic illegally downloaded nearly 500,000 copyrighted works on Library Genesis (LibGen) and Pirate Library Mirror (PiLiMi) to train its AI chatbot, Claude.\\nAnthropic is expected to pay copyright owners $3,000 per book included in the settlement. Authors and copyright owners not on the list won't be eligible for settlement payments.\\nThis is the first major settlement by an AI company related to the use of copyrighted materials to train large language models, but it likely won't be the last.\\n\\\"I'm happy to see some accountability for the way companies like this have stolen authors' works,\\\" said CNET senior writer Jeff Carlson, the author of several books that were included in the settlement. \\\"And the prospect of a settlement amount that isn't just a small token amount is somewhat exciting. But since this is also book publishing, I'm taking it with a grain of salt so far because that's often all that authors end up with.\\\"\\nTo get the money, authors will have to file a claim with the settlement administrator. Here's how.\\nWhat happens now?\\nNow that the settlement has reached a preliminary approval, the case is now moving into the notice and claims phase.\\nThe website, AnthropicCopyrightSettlement.com, includes a searchable list of works included in the settlement, important documents, key dates, and instructions on how to file a claim once authors receive their official settlement notice.\\nWho can receive a payout?\\nOnly members of the LibGen & PiLiMi Pirated Books Class can qualify for payments. In order to be qualified as a class member, the following must be true:\\n- You must be the copyright owner of a book on the list of those downloaded from LibGen or PiLiMi by Anthropic. The book must have an ISBN (International Standard Book Number) or ASIN (Amazon Standard Identification Number).\\n- The book was registered with the US Copyright Office within five years of its first publication and before being downloaded by Anthropic or within three months of publication.\\nIf you fit those criteria, you are considered a class member, but it doesn't mean you'll automatically get paid out. For that to happen, you'll need to file a claim.\\nWhat can authors do right now?\\nAuthors are beginning to receive official notices, which will be sent via email, US mail and other methods. Here's what authors can do now while they wait and how to file a claim.\\nDouble-check you're on the official works list\\nThe official list of books covered by the case is on the official website. This is an important distinction, as if you found your work on another website that included your work, it might not be considered in the final list. Other lists may have included incorrect data or dates.\\nThe Works List Lookup page lets authors search for their books via ISBN\\/ASIN, title, author name and publisher. If your book isn't found within this list, you likely will not receive an official notice.\\nYou can always reach out to the claims admin team if you have questions.\\nFile a claim by March 2026\\nIf you've received your official notice already, you will be able to submit a claim for the settlement. Until you receive this notice, you will not be able to move forward. That's because each notice will have a unique ID number associated with it that will allow authors to file a claim.\\nAuthors have until March 23, 2026 to file a claim.\\nOnce you receive your notice, head over to the file a claim page on the website and enter the ID on the notice to proceed. Follow the instructions to submit your claim.\"\n",

The admission followed a discovery by a University of Sydney academic who found multiple references to research that did not exist.\\nThe incident underscores a growing debate over the use of AI systems in professional consultancy work, particularly when those tools generate references or conclusions without human verification. While Deloitte maintains that the policy recommendations remain valid, the incident has drawn attention to the transparency requirements associated with AI-assisted analysis in government contracts.\\nThe Targeted Compliance Framework Assurance Review, completed in July and commissioned by the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations (DEWR), examined the government's automated penalty system for welfare violations.\\nDeloitte's work was intended to assess whether system code matched business requirements and policy compliance standards. It was published in August, but within weeks, academics flagged serious problems.\\nChris Rudge, deputy director of health law at the University of Sydney, found citations to numerous nonexistent articles, including reports attributed to Lisa Burton Crawford, a law professor at the same institution who confirmed she had never authored the works in question. \\\"It is concerning to see research attributed to me in this way,\\\" Crawford told the Australian Financial Review. \\\"I would like to see an explanation from Deloitte as to how the citations were generated.\\\"\\nBuried on page 58 was a new disclosure that Deloitte's technical team had used \\\"a generative AI large language model (Azure OpenAI GPT-4o) based tool chain\\\" during its analysis.\\nThe DEWR released an updated version of the 273-page review on Friday, noting it had made \\\"a small number of corrections to references and footnotes.\\\" Buried on page 58 was a new disclosure that Deloitte's technical team had used \\\"a generative AI large language model (Azure OpenAI GPT-4o) based tool chain\\\" during its analysis.\\nThe model was applied to determine whether the welfare system's software code could be mapped to compliance rules \\u2013 an application that, in this case, produced inaccurate references.\\nThe revised report also removed a fabricated judicial quote originally attributed to Federal Justice Jennifer Davies, whose name had been misspelled as \\\"Davis\\\" in Deloitte's initial publication. Of the 141 works listed in the original reference section, only 127 appear in the updated document. References to fictitious publications by Crawford and other academics were deleted without further explanation.\\nDeloitte told the AFR that it would return the final instalment of its government payment, though neither party clarified what percentage of the total fee this covered. A DEWR spokesperson said, \\\"The substance of the independent review is retained, and there are no changes to the recommendations.\\\"\\nRudge, however, questioned the integrity of those recommendations. \\\"You cannot trust the recommendations when the very foundation of the report is built on a flawed, originally undisclosed, and non-expert methodology,\\\" he said. \\\"Deloitte has admitted to using generative AI for a core analytical task; but it failed to disclose this in the first place.\\\"\"\n",

In the absence of a standard, developers building coding agents have to create separate add-ins for each editor they support, or rely on a command-line interface (CLI) that works in the terminal, independent of any specific editor.\\nGoogle told us that using Gemini CLI alone means that \\\"developers constantly switch between the command line... and their IDE for coding, which is inefficient and breaks concentration.\\\" This problem led the team toward a collaboration with Zed in developing IDE integration, which evolved into the ACP standard, designed to work with any editor that implements it.\\nThe Rust-based Zed has a small market share, whereas JetBrains is second only to Microsoft, whose Visual Studio Code (VS Code) and Visual Studio are the first and second most popular IDEs, according to most surveys.\\nJetBrains has stated that it will now support ACP and is collaborating with Zed on developing the protocol. The company highlights the top benefit as \\\"no vendor lock-in\\\" since developers will be able to use their preferred coding assistant from any IDE that supports the protocol.\\nMicrosoft is the beneficiary of a familiar winner-takes-all pattern with VS Code, which is used by over 75 percent of developers, according to a recent survey. The VS Code marketplace has over 80,000 extensions, whereas JetBrains invites users to \\\"search 10,000 extensions,\\\" and the vendor-neutral Open VSX Registry has just under 7,000.\\n- Kicked from RubyGems, maintainers forge new home at Gem Cooperative\\n- Dirty little Electron secret tanks macOS 26 performance\\n- JetBrains wants to train AI models on your code snippets\\n- Zed's dead, baby. Zed's dead? No, wait \\u2013 it's on Windows\\nACP will not solve VS Code extension lock-in on its own, but it could benefit competing IDEs in the hot area of coding agent support. A key question is whether VS Code itself will support ACP. There is an open issue designated \\\"under discussion\\\" and assigned to Microsoft engineer Rob Lourens. Lourens said on GitHub that \\\"this is interesting, but I don't plan to implement it right away.\\\"\\nThe Rust-based Zed has a small market share, whereas JetBrains is second only to Microsoft, whose Visual Studio Code (VS Code) and Visual Studio are the first and second most popular IDEs\\nThere might also be some benefit to Microsoft in implementing ACP since the company also provides Visual Studio, its Windows-only IDE, which has a different extension model than VS Code. Via ACP, compatible coding agents would work with both products.\\nIt is early days for ACP, described on GitHub as \\\"still under heavy development.\\\" There is, however, support for the Emacs and Neovim editors via extensions, and some progress on ACP for Eclipse.\\nDevelopers may also hope that ACP will make coding agent integration more reliable. The official VS Code plugin for Gemini Code Assist is the subject of many complaints such as \\\"most of the time hangs\\\" and \\\"extension has huge memory leak.\\\" A new Gemini CLI extension in preview looks more promising, though with limited features. \\u00ae\"\n",

According to a draft seen by the Financial Times, the initiative will promote European-built AI platforms to strengthen the bloc\\u2019s industrial competitiveness and technological resilience across key sectors such as healthcare, defence, and manufacturing. The document warns that Europe\\u2019s dependence on external providers leaves its critical infrastructure and software vulnerable to weaponisation by hostile actors.\\nOpenAI gives content owners more control on Sora\\nOpenAI is introducing new tools that let content rights holders decide how their intellectual property is used in its AI video-generation platform, Sora. Announced by CEO Sam Altman, the update allows film and TV studios to block or permit the use of their characters under specific terms as part of a broader effort to share revenue with creators who opt in.\\nAltman said the new rights tools offer \\u201cmore granular control,\\u201d as Hollywood adapts to AI-driven content creation and attempts to balance creative freedom with fair compensation. Altman also conceded that despite tighter safeguards, \\u201csome edge cases of generations that get through that shouldn\\u2019t\\u201d are inevitably a nod to the ongoing challenge of policing AI-generated content at scale.\\nBut resistance is already building: sources told Reuters that Disney has chosen to block its content from appearing in Sora, underscoring growing friction between tech platforms and traditional studios.\\nInstagram tests iPad-style layout, opening on Reels\\nInstagram is experimenting with a major redesign that makes Reels the default home tab, part of an opt-in test rolling out in India. The update shifts the app\\u2019s layout to prioritise short-form video and direct messages, two of the platform\\u2019s biggest growth drivers, according to Instagram head Adam Mosseri.\\nIn a demo shared by Mosseri, the top section retains familiar elements, most notably the horizontal Stories bar, but as users scroll, the layout transitions seamlessly into a full-screen Reels view, mirroring the current Reels tab experience where video dominates the feed.

Instead, AI companies are hiring in droves, fueling a resurgence of Silicon Valley offices.\\nSocial card description: Some AI executives are predicting huge job losses. Yet, AI companies are hiring so much it's boosting Silicon Valley's office market.\\n- Some AI executives have been predicting big job losses due to the technology.\\n- Yet, many AI companies are hiring huge numbers of human employees.\\n- That's driving an unlikely resurgence in Silicon Valley's office market.\\nEric Simons, CEO of AI startup StackBlitz, recently announced a new office lease in San Francisco. It's in Levi's Plaza, a swanky location near the water. The buildout is underway, and employees are expected to move in around January.\\nA few years ago, this was unheard of. Tech offices across Silicon Valley shut down as employees transitioned to remote work during the pandemic. The region's commercial real estate market plunged, and vacancies soared.\\nNow, though, the artificial intelligence boom is fueling a recovery. It's a strange phenomenon. Generative AI is supposed to automate many tasks, with some industry executives predicting huge job losses. However, if you examine the actions of AI companies, rather than their words, a different future begins to emerge.\\nThe reality is that many AI companies are hiring a huge number of human employees. These are experts at putting AI to work, so they should be shedding staff, right? Instead, it's a hiring frenzy, and these growing workforces are now being housed in fancy offices across Silicon Valley and other urban, educated locations.\\n\\\"AI companies are leasing because they're hiring,\\\" researchers at commercial real estate firm Colliers told Business Insider. \\\"Generative AI is reshaping the workforce, but it's also fueling new job creation that drives office demand.\\\"\\nA recent report from Colliers concluded that the tech industry has become a major driver of the US office market.\\nIn Silicon Valley, the average size of these leases has grown consistently over the past three years. So far in 2025, the office market there has reached its highest average lease size since 2020, according to Colliers data.\\nRelated stories\\nSince 2020, there have been 5.2 million square feet of office lease transactions by AI and AI-infrastructure companies in Silicon Valley (excluding Apple, Alphabet, or Meta). 2025 has already surpassed the full-year total for 2024 of 1.3 million square feet, according to Colliers' data.\\nThe firm has seen significant office leasing activity in Sunnyvale, California, for pure AI companies and in Fremont, California, for AI-infrastructure companies, due to the high prevalence of advanced manufacturing in these areas. While most of the companies already have a presence in this market, many of the new firms specialize in robotics.\\nThe takeaway from this activity: Take predictions of an AI job apocalypse with a large grain of salt. If AI companies themselves are hiring a lot of humans, then perhaps other employers will follow suit.\\nSign up for BI's Tech Memo newsletter here.

The move makes IBM the latest large company to partner with Anthropic, with recent examples including Microsoft and Deloitte.\\nAccording to a press release, IBM will use Claude to power a new integrated development environment, often referred to as an IDE. These virtual environments are applications that enable software developers to write and edit code outside of their computer terminal, see which files they\\u2019re currently working with, and use special tools built within the application. Several startups building AI-powered IDEs, such as Cursor and Windsurf, have rapidly grown due to an explosion of interest in AI-assisted coding, sometimes referred to as \\u201cvibe coding.\\u201d\\nIBM\\u2019s new Claude-powered IDE is currently available exclusively to select IBM clients. In early testing, the company says, users have reported \\u201cproductivity gains averaging 45 percent.\\u201d\\nIn addition to the IDE, IBM has created a new guide for creating and managing AI agents in the enterprise. The guide, which has been verified by Anthropic, provides businesses with a \\u201cpurpose-built, enterprise-ready approach for the development, operations and security requirements for Enterprise AI agents.\\u201d\\nSince its launch in 2023, Claude has become a popular AI model for business use cases, and adoption by large enterprises is starting to pick up. Microsoft, which has invested over $10 billion in Anthropic rival OpenAI, announced in late September that it would begin using Claude in its work-focused 365 Copilot platform.\\nOn October 7, Anthropic and consulting giant Deloitte announced a partnership that will make Claude available to all of Deloitte\\u2019s 470,000 employees, the AI company\\u2019s largest enterprise deployment to date. Anthropic said in a blog post that Deloitte will \\u201cestablish a Claude Center of Excellence with trained specialists who will develop implementation frameworks, share leading practices across deployments, and provide ongoing technical support to create the systems needed to move AI pilots to production at scale.\\u201d\\nWeekly roundup of the latest in tech news\\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\\nPrivacy PolicyThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\\nPrivacy Policy\"\n",

For example, a user might first ask the agent to switch an app\\u2019s color scheme, and while that\\u2019s in progress, line up additional instructions to display a welcome message on the homepage, add a login button, and save user accounts.\\nIt\\u2019s all about bringing structure to multi-task AI development, allowing developers to queue tasks, adjust their order, and iterate mid-build. They can also pause the active task to test or debug, before the next queued instruction begins.\\nIt\\u2019s wise to pause for thought\\nWhile Queue allows developers to queue up multiple prompts at once, some recommend a more measured approach: pausing after a few tasks to check results before proceeding. This helps catch errors early, and keep the agent on track.\\nThis relates to other concerns raised by the community, that queuing up different types of tasks within the same chat thread could blur context, an issue that is compounded as more tasks are added to the pot.\\nFor example, when switching between database work and UI design, will the agent stay focused on each task individually, or might it become confused if the developer switches topics or tries to follow up later?\\nPausing might help catch execution issues, but it doesn\\u2019t fully address the need for clearer task separation. Features like isolated threads or scoped prompts could help keep the agent grounded in more complex, multi-domain workflows.\\nCoding agents: from black box to team collaboration\\nQueue addresses a key friction point for AI-native software developers: the stop-start nature of interacting with agents one prompt at a time. By allowing multiple instructions to be stacked and managed as a sequence, developers can stay focused on other work as the agent whirs in the background.\\nA happy by-product of all this is that AI agents begin to feel less like a black box, and more like a collaborative team member that can execute and adapt to tasks under light supervision.\\nThat said, as workflows grow more complex, the risk of context loss (particularly across unrelated tasks) could still prove problematic, and may require more explicit task boundaries or agent memory controls.\"\n",

There\\u2019s no lack of demand: hugging face\\u2019s SO-100 and LeKiwi are pretty clear successes already; but the hardware is unreliable, the software experience is barebone and keeps changing, and you often need to buy hidden extras to make them work (starting with a computer with a good gpu). The Turtlebots were good, but are getting outdated.\\nThe open-source hobbyist movement lacks really good platforms to build on, and we wanted something robust and accessible. MARS is our attempt at making a first intuitive AI robot for everyone.\\nWhat it is:\\n- It comes assembled and calibrated\\n- Has onboard compute with a jetson orin nano 8gb\\n- a 5DoF arm with a wrist camera\\n- Sensors: RGBD wide-angle cam, 2D LiDAR, speakers\\n- Control via a dedicated app and a leader arm that plugs in iPhone and Android\\n- 2 additional USB ports + GPIO pins for extra sensors or effectors.\\n- And our novel SDK called BASIC that allows to run it like an AI agent with VLAs.\\nIt boots in a minute, can be controlled via phone, programmable in depth with a PC, and the onboard agent lets it see, talk, plan, and act in real-time.\\nOur SDK BASIC allows to create \\u201cbehaviors\\u201d (our name for programs) ranging from a simple hello world to a very complex long-horizon task involving reasoning, planning, navigation and manipulation.

The idea that one must rely on massive foundational models trained for millions of dollars by some big corporation in order to achieve success on hard tasks is a trap. Currently, there is too much focus on exploiting LLMs rather than devising and expanding new lines of direction. With recursive reasoning, it turns out that \\u201cless is more\\u201d: you don\\u2019t always need to crank up model size in order for a model to reason and solve hard problems. A tiny model pretrained from scratch, recursing on itself and updating its answers over time, can achieve a lot without breaking the bank.\\nThis work came to be after I learned about the recent innovative Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM). I was amazed that an approach using small models could do so well on hard tasks like the ARC-AGI competition (reaching 40% accuracy when normally only Large Language Models could compete). But I kept thinking that it is too complicated, relying too much on biological arguments about the human brain, and that this recursive reasoning process could be greatly simplified and improved. Tiny Recursion Model (TRM) simplifies recursive reasoning to its core essence, which ultimately has nothing to do with the human brain, does not require any mathematical (fixed-point) theorem, nor any hierarchy.\\nSee the paper for more details.\\nTLDR\\nTiny Recursion Model (TRM) recursively improves its predicted answer y with a tiny network. It starts with the embedded input question x and initial embedded answer y and latent z. For up to K improvements steps, it tries to improve its answer y. It does so by i) recursively updating n times its latent z given the question x, current answer y, and current latent z (recursive reasoning), and then ii) updating its answer y given the current answer y and current latent z. This recursive process allows the model to progressively improve its answer (potentially addressing any errors from its previous answer) in an extremely parameter-efficient manner while minimizing overfitting.\"\n",

But creators and viewers of Sora 2 videos are finding that prohibition has a rather large loophole, allowing for videos of public figures that happen to be dead.\\nExamples of celebrities being posthumously inserted into Sora 2 video creations are not hard to find all over social media these days. Tupac Shakur chatting with Malcolm X. Bruce Lee running a \\\"dragon energy\\\" DJ set. Michael Jackson doing kitchen-based standup comedy. Stephen Hawking's wheelchair wiping out on a giant skateboard ramp. Mister Rogers doing a cameo on Jackass. Kurt Cobain stealing KFC chicken fingers. Martin Luther King Jr. stuttering through a major speech. The list goes on and on.\\nOpenAI places a moving Sora watermark over each generated video, which limits the risk of viewers being fooled by fake footage of real people. Still, seeing these deceased celebrities used as props by an AI tool can obviously be upsetting to their living relatives and fans.\\n\\\"Please stop sending me AI videos of dad,\\\" Zelda Williams said in a since-deleted Instagram story Monday (archived here), referring to her late father Robin Williams. \\\"Stop believing I wanna see it or that I'll understand, I don't and I won't... It's dumb, it's a waste of time and energy, and believe me, it's NOT what he'd want.\\\"\\nThe reference to what the late Williams would have wanted is important here. OpenAI notes that living users, including public figures, can opt in to Sora 2's \\\"cameos\\\" feature by scanning their own face with a smartphone to \\\"drop yourself straight into any Sora scene with remarkable fidelity.\\\" OpenAI promises that cameo users \\\"are in control of your likeness end-to-end\\\" and that the feature is designed \\\"to ensure that your audio and image likeness are used with your consent.\\\" Cameo users can also revoke access to their scanned images at any time and have moderation control over other videos created with that scan.\\nWhat a world we live in.\"\n",

The approach uses machine learning and physics-based simulations to predict plasma instabilities and prevent damage during tokamak shutdowns.\\nExperimental tokamaks use strong magnets to contain plasma hotter than the sun\\u2019s core. They often face challenges in safely ramping down plasma currents that circulate at extreme speeds and temperatures.\\nThe model was trained and tested on data from the Swiss TCV tokamak. Combining neural networks with physics simulations, the team achieved accurate predictions using few plasma pulses, saving costs and overcoming limited experimental data.\\nThe system can now generate practical \\u2018trajectories\\u2019 for controllers to adjust magnets and temperatures, helping to safely manage plasma during shutdowns.\\nResearchers say the method could be particularly important as fusion devices scale up to grid-level energy production. High-energy plasmas in larger reactors pose greater risks, and uncontrolled terminations could damage the machine.\\nThe new model allows operators to carefully balance rampdowns, avoiding disruptions and ensuring safer, more efficient operation.\\nWork on the predictive model is part of wider collaboration with Commonwealth Fusion Systems and supported by the EUROfusion Consortium and Swiss research institutions.

This study aimed to develop a prediction model for PLOS based on clinical features throughout pre-, intra-, and post-operative periods in patients undergoing laparoscopic gastrointestinal surgery. This secondary analysis included patients who underwent laparoscopic gastrointestinal surgery in the FDP-PONV randomized controlled trial. This study defined PLOS as a postoperative length of stay longer than 7\\u00a0days. All clinical features prospectively collected in the FDP-PONV trial were used to generate the models. This study employed six machine learning algorithms including logistic regression, K-nearest neighbor, gradient boosting machine, random forest, support vector machine, and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). The model performance was evaluated by numerous metrics including area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and interpreted using shapley additive explanations (SHAP). Cases on or before 2021\\u201312-18 formed the training cohort (802 patients) and those after that date formed the validation cohort (339 patients). Among the models evaluated, the XGBoost model demonstrated the best performance in the validation cohort, achieving an AUC of 0.756. After five times repeated tenfold cross-validation, the XGBoost model demonstrated a mean AUC of 0.816. SHAP plots were generated based on the predictors: education level; preoperative hypoalbuminemia and insufficient sleep; surgery type and duration; blood loss; postoperative hypotension; postoperative albumin infusion; highest pain score during 73\\u2013120\\u00a0h after surgery; time to first flatus and defecation; postoperative infection; and postoperative acute kidney injury. This study developed a prediction model using machine learning to identify patients at high risk of PLOS after laparoscopic gastrointestinal surgery. The FDP-PONV trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04853147) on 2021\\u201304-27.\\n\\n- Developed and validated a machine learning prediction model for prolonged postoperative length of stay (PLOS >7 days) after laparoscopic gastrointestinal surgery using data from 1141 patients in the FDP-PONV trial; XGBoost model achieved the best performance with an AUC of 0.756 in validation and 0.816 in repeated cross-validation.\\n- Key predictive features include surgery duration, postoperative pain, gastrointestinal recovery times, blood loss, infections, albumin infusion, postoperative hypotension, insufficient sleep, education level, and acute kidney injury; model interpretation used SHAP analysis for feature importance.\\n- The model is implemented as a web-based calculator to facilitate clinical use, aiming to identify high-risk patients for targeted interventions to reduce hospital stay and associated costs, with plans for external validation and integration into electronic health records.\"\n",

This study aimed to develop a prediction model for PLOS based on clinical features throughout pre-, intra-, and post-operative periods in patients undergoing laparoscopic gastrointestinal surgery. This secondary analysis included patients who underwent laparoscopic gastrointestinal surgery in the FDP-PONV randomized controlled trial. This study defined PLOS as a postoperative length of stay longer than 7&nbsp;days. All clinical features prospectively collected in the FDP-PONV trial were used to generate the models. This study employed six machine learning algorithms including logistic regression, K-nearest neighbor, gradient boosting machine, random forest, support vector machine, and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). The model performance was evaluated by numerous metrics including area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and interpreted using shapley additive explanations (SHAP). Cases on or before 2021\\u201312-18 formed the training cohort (802 patients) and those after that date formed the validation cohort (339 patients). Among the models evaluated, the XGBoost model demonstrated the best performance in the validation cohort, achieving an AUC of 0.756. After five times repeated tenfold cross-validation, the XGBoost model demonstrated a mean AUC of 0.816.

This study aimed to develop a prediction model for PLOS based on clinical features throughout pre-, intra-, and post-operative periods in patients undergoing laparoscopic gastrointestinal surgery. This secondary analysis included patients who underwent laparoscopic gastrointestinal surgery in the FDP-PONV randomized controlled trial. This study defined PLOS as a postoperative length of stay longer than 7 days. All clinical features prospectively collected in the FDP-PONV trial were used to generate the models. This study employed six machine learning algorithms including logistic regression, K-nearest neighbor, gradient boosting machine, random forest, support vector machine, and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). The model performance was evaluated by numerous metrics including area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and interpreted using shapley additive explanations (SHAP). Cases on or before 2021–12-18 formed the training cohort (802 patients) and those after that date formed the validation cohort (339 patients). Among the models evaluated, the XGBoost model demonstrated the best performance in the validation cohort, achieving an AUC of 0.756. After five times repeated tenfold cross-validation, the XGBoost model demonstrated a mean AUC of 0.816. SHAP plots were generated based on the predictors: education level; preoperative hypoalbuminemia and insufficient sleep; surgery type and duration; blood loss; postoperative hypotension; postoperative albumin infusion; highest pain score during 73–120 h after surgery; time to first flatus and defecation; postoperative infection; and postoperative acute kidney injury. This study developed a prediction model using machine learning to identify patients at high risk of PLOS after laparoscopic gastrointestinal surgery.

WHY IT'S IMPORTANT While large corporations are steadily adopting AI software and scaling up investments, small businesses across Europe often lack relevant expertise and digital infrastructure. Companies are turning to this technology to automate tasks and reduce costs across the board, resulting in job cuts which are shaking up entire industries.\n",
      "\n",
      "- A study by French fintech Qonto reveals that 46% of European small and mid-sized enterprises (SMEs) use AI tools like ChatGPT daily but lag in adopting basic digital tools such as digital accounting and data analytics, risking competitive disadvantage.\n",
      "- Larger firms are advancing with core digital infrastructure investments while many SMEs feel unprepared for digital transformation; Germany reports high readiness (76%) contrasted with challenges in France where nearly half feel ill-equipped.\n",
      "- Experts emphasize building robust digital foundations to support AI integration; calls for targeted interventions include reducing regulatory burdens, addressing skill shortages, and overcoming cultural resistance to boost Europe’s economic resilience and innovation capabilities.\n",

      "\n",
      "- The paper reveals that gradient descent in deep learning operates at the \"edge of stability\" (EOS), repeatedly exiting and re-entering stable regions due to oscillations along the top Hessian eigenvector, a phenomenon explained by third-order Taylor expansions introducing a negative feedback mechanism reducing sharpness.\n",
      "- The authors develop a new differential equation called the central flow, accurately modeling the time-averaged trajectory of gradient descent even during EOS, contrasting traditional gradient flow which fails to capture these dynamics and the associated optimization oscillations.\n",
      "- The central flow provides smooth, monotonic loss decrease predictions that align closely with observed training, offering a simpler and more precise theoretical framework for understanding deep learning optimization dynamics across architectures and tasks, with implications for improved analysis and potential future research directions.\n",

      "Prolonged postoperative length of stay (PLOS) is associated with several clinical risks and increased medical costs. This study aimed to develop a prediction model for PLOS based on clinical features throughout pre-, intra-, and post-operative periods in patients undergoing laparoscopic gastrointestinal surgery. This secondary analysis included patients who underwent laparoscopic gastrointestinal surgery in the FDP-PONV randomized controlled trial. This study defined PLOS as a postoperative length of stay longer than 7 days. All clinical features prospectively collected in the FDP-PONV trial were used to generate the models. This study employed six machine learning algorithms including logistic regression, K-nearest neighbor, gradient boosting machine, random forest, support vector machine, and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). The model performance was evaluated by numerous metrics including area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and interpreted using shapley additive explanations (SHAP). Cases on or before 2021–12-18 formed the training cohort (802 patients) and those after that date formed the validation cohort (339 patients). Among the models evaluated, the XGBoost model demonstrated the best performance in the validation cohort, achieving an AUC of 0.756. After five times repeated tenfold cross-validation, the XGBoost model demonstrated a mean AUC of 0.816. SHAP plots were generated based on the predictors: education level; preoperative hypoalbuminemia and insufficient sleep; surgery type and duration; blood loss; postoperative hypotension; postoperative albumin infusion; highest pain score during 73–120 h after surgery; time to first flatus and defecation; postoperative infection; and postoperative acute kidney injury. This study developed a prediction model using machine learning to identify patients at high risk of PLOS after laparoscopic gastrointestinal surgery. The FDP-PONV trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04853147) on 2021–04-27.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Developed and validated a machine learning prediction model for prolonged postoperative length of stay (PLOS >7 days) after laparoscopic gastrointestinal surgery using data from 1141 patients in the FDP-PONV trial; XGBoost model achieved the best performance with an AUC of 0.756 in validation and 0.816 in repeated cross-validation.\n",
      "- Key predictive features include surgery duration, postoperative pain, gastrointestinal recovery times, blood loss, infections, albumin infusion, postoperative hypotension, insufficient sleep, education level, and acute kidney injury; model interpretation used SHAP analysis for feature importance.\n",
      "- The model is implemented as a web-based calculator to facilitate clinical use, aiming to identify high-risk patients for targeted interventions to reduce hospital stay and associated costs, with plans for external validation and integration into electronic health records.\n",

       "Prolonged postoperative length of stay (PLOS) is associated with several clinical risks and increased medical costs. This study aimed to develop a prediction model for PLOS based on clinical features throughout pre-, intra-, and post-operative periods in patients undergoing laparoscopic gastrointestinal surgery. This secondary analysis included patients who underwent laparoscopic gastrointestinal surgery in the FDP-PONV randomized controlled trial. This study defined PLOS as a postoperative length of stay longer than 7 days. All clinical features prospectively collected in the FDP-PONV trial were used to generate the models. This study employed six machine learning algorithms including logistic regression, K-nearest neighbor, gradient boosting machine, random forest, support vector machine, and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). The model performance was evaluated by numerous metrics including area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and interpreted using shapley additive explanations (SHAP). Cases on or before 2021–12-18 formed the training cohort (802 patients) and those after that date formed the validation cohort (339 patients). Among the models evaluated, the XGBoost model demonstrated the best performance in the validation cohort, achieving an AUC of 0.756. After five times repeated tenfold cross-validation, the XGBoost model demonstrated a mean AUC of 0.816. SHAP plots were generated based on the predictors: education level; preoperative hypoalbuminemia and insufficient sleep; surgery type and duration; blood loss; postoperative hypotension; postoperative albumin infusion; highest pain score during 73–120 h after surgery; time to first flatus and defecation; postoperative infection; and postoperative acute kidney injury. This study developed a prediction model using machine learning to identify patients at high risk of PLOS after laparoscopic gastrointestinal surgery. The FDP-PONV trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04853147) on 2021–04-27.\n",
       "\n",
       "- Developed and validated a machine learning prediction model for prolonged postoperative length of stay (PLOS >7 days) after laparoscopic gastrointestinal surgery using data from 1141 patients in the FDP-PONV trial; XGBoost model achieved the best performance with an AUC of 0.756 in validation and 0.816 in repeated cross-validation.\n",
       "- Key predictive features include surgery duration, postoperative pain, gastrointestinal recovery times, blood loss, infections, albumin infusion, postoperative hypotension, insufficient sleep, education level, and acute kidney injury; model interpretation used SHAP analysis for feature importance.\n",
       "- The model is implemented as a web-based calculator to facilitate clinical use, aiming to identify high-risk patients for targeted interventions to reduce hospital stay and associated costs, with plans for external validation and integration into electronic health records.\n",
