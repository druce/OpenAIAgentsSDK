       "**c) Radar Tracking**  \n",

       "\n",
       "He approached the problem like this:\n",
       "- **Estimate the wing-beat frequency:** For a European Swallow, this is about 15 beats per second.\n",
       "- **Estimate the distance traveled per wing beat:** Pennycuick estimated around 0.73 meters forward per beat.\n",
       "- **Do the math:**  \n",
       "    ```\n",
       "    Airspeed = Wingbeat frequency × Distance per beat\n",
       "    Airspeed ≈ 15 Hz × 0.73 m\n",

       "\n",
       "### **3. Published Scientific Sources**\n",
       "- **Charles J. Pennycuick (Bird Flight Performance, Oxford 1989)** and similar works provide the math and observational backing for these results.\n",
       "- Further refinements come from field guides and migration studies, which confirm swallows’ steady cruising speeds fit right around that 11 m/s mark.\n",
       "\n",
       "---\n",
