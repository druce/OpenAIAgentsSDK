# Newsletter Agent System

An AI-powered newsletter generation system built on the OpenAI Agents SDK that implements a 9-step workflow for automated newsletter creation from multiple news sources.

Note: This is a work in progress, the intent is to port the AInewsbot repo to the OpenAI Agents SDK. Currently it runs the first 6 steps, fetching, filtering and downloading articles, extracting summaries, clustering by topic, and rating articles. The remaining steps are mocked. Check back in a few weeks for a complete implementation.

## Overview

This system automatically gathers news articles from RSS feeds, HTML scraping targets, and REST APIs, filters them for AI-related content using LLM classification, downloads full article content, generates summaries, clusters articles by topic, rates content quality, and produces a polished newsletter ready for distribution.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install Playwright browsers for web scraping
playwright install chromium

# Set up environment variables
cp dot-env.txt .env
# Edit .env with your API keys
```

### Run the Newsletter Agent

```bash
# Generate a complete newsletter
python news_agent.py

```

### Interactive Development

Open and run `test_agent.ipynb` for step-by-step development and testing:

```bash
jupyter notebook test_agent.ipynb
```

## 📋 Complete 9-Step Workflow

The newsletter generation follows a structured 9-step process with persistent state management:

### Step 1: Gather URLs 📰

- **Sources**: Fetches from 17+ configured news sources
- **Types**: RSS feeds, HTML scraping, REST APIs
- **Output**: raw article URLs and titles

### Step 2: Filter URLs 🔍

- **AI Classification**: Uses LLM to identify AI-related content
- **Dedupe**: Filters out articles seen before by matching URL or title/source (with date override to rerun)
- **Batch Processing**: Efficiently processes articles in batches
- **Output**: ~200 AI-related articles (typical 50% filter rate on 400+ new articles per day)

### Step 3: Download Articles ⬇️
- **Concurrent Scraping**: Parallel asynchronous Playwright workers with per-domain rate limiting
- **Output**:
  - Redirect URLs
  - Clean article content (trafilatura extraction)
  - Article metadata (publication date, open graph metadata)
  - Dedupe using embeddings + cosine similarity for e.g. syndicated articles on different URLs

### Step 4: Extract Summaries 📝
- **AI Summarization**: Generates bullet-point summaries for each article
- **Key Insights**: Identifies main technological developments and business implications
- **Output**: 3-point summaries stored in persistent state

### Step 5: Cluster by Topic 🏷️
- **Categories**: Apply free-form topics and canonical topics like AI Safety & Ethics, OpenAI, etc. via prompts; ask LLM to identify a few top topics that match articles
- **Thematic Grouping**: Organize articles into topic clusters using HDBSCAN over dimensionality-reduced embeddings
- **Output**: Topic tags and clusters

### Step 6: Rate Articles ⭐
- **Quality Scoring**: Assigns quality ratings (1-10) to each article using a prompt and ELO type importance comparisons
- **Relevance**: Initial pass: it it spammy, on-topic, important? use LLM and output logrobs
- **Quality**: Run battles asking LLM to compare articles according to a rubric: quality, impact, novelty, etc.
- **Reputation**: articles from reputable sources get boost points
- **Recency**: downrate old articles
- **Frequency**: If same story is covered by several articles, pick highest rated and boost points based on how many articles cover same set of facts
- **Output**: Deduped articles with ratings

### Step 7: Select Sections 📑
- **Newsletter Structure**: Chooses top articles for each section
- **Content Planning**: Organizes articles by topic clusters
- **Output**: Newsletter section outline with assigned articles

### Step 8: Draft Sections ✍️
- **Content Creation**: Writes engaging content  and title for each section
- **Output**: Drafted newsletter sections

### Step 9: Compose Final Newsletter 🎉
- **Assembly**: Combines all sections into final newsletter
- **Quality Control**: Applies final formatting and polish
- **Output**: Complete newsletter ready for distribution
