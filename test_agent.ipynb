       "\n",
       "#### D) **Derived Formula**\n",
       "Physics-minded folks have created simplified models. For instance, using lift, drag, and power equations for small birds, you can estimate the optimal cruising speed (called \"minimum power speed\").\n",

       "#### E) **Actual Measurements**\n",
       "- Average speeds measured for swallows in level commuting flight (e.g. between nests and feeding areas) fall in the range **10–11 meters per second**, confirmed by multiple radar- and camera-based studies.\n",
       "\n",
       "### 3. **The Famous Calculation (Nerd Corner)**\n",
       "The “11 m/s” number popularized on the web (and by Dr. Karl Kruszelnicki, among others) comes from calculations like:\n",
       "\n",
       "\\[\n",
       "\\text{Airspeed} = \\text{Flight distance per wingbeat} \\times \\text{Wingbeat frequency}\n",
       "\\]\n",
       "\n",
       "But real birds don’t move forward one wingspan per flap, so additional aerodynamic factors are rolled in:\n",

       "\n",
       "### 4. **In Plain English**\n",
       "Ornithologists didn’t just guesstimate—they used a combination of:\n",
       "- Observing birds in the wild\n",
       "- Calculating using physics and biology\n",
       "- Measuring with modern tracking tools\n",
       "\n",
       "### **BONUS:** If you ever want to compute a *swallow’s coconut-carrying velocity*, you’d need to factor in drag, weight, and the poor bird’s protestations!\n",
       "\n",
       "---\n",
       "\n",
       "**TL;DR:**  \n",
       "The famous “11 meters per second” airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow comes from *real measurements* of wild birds, bolstered by *aerodynamic equations* that factor in things like wingbeat frequency, wingspan, and the physics of bird flight. Not just comedy—real science!"
